<a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE MARKET-PLACE AND BELFRY&mdash;EARLY
HISTORY OF BRUGES</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">E</span><span class="smcap">very</span> visitor to 'the quaint old Flemish city' goes
first to the Market-Place. On Saturday mornings
the wide space beneath the mighty Belfry is full of
stalls, with white canvas awnings, and heaped up
with a curious assortment of goods. Clothing of
every description, sabots and leathern shoes and
boots, huge earthenware jars, pots and pans,
kettles, cups and saucers, baskets, tawdry-coloured
prints&mdash;chiefly of a religious character&mdash;lamps and
candlesticks, the cheaper kinds of Flemish pottery,
knives and forks, carpenters' tools, and such small
articles as reels of thread, hatpins, tape, and even
bottles of coarse scent, are piled on the stalls or
spread out on the rough stones wherever there is a
vacant space. Round the stalls, in the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
spaces between them, the people move about,
talking, laughing, and bargaining. Their native
Flemish is the tongue they use amongst themselves;
but many of them speak what passes for
French at Bruges, or even a few words of broken
English, if some unwary stranger from across the
Channel is rash enough to venture on doing business
with these sharp-witted, plausible folk.</p>

<p>At first sight this Market-Place, so famed in
song, is a disappointment. The north side is
occupied by a row of seventeenth-century houses
turned into shops and third-rate cafés. On the
east is a modern post-office, dirty and badly
ventilated, and some half-finished Government
buildings. On the west are two houses which
were once of some note&mdash;the Cranenburg, from
the windows of which, in olden times, the Counts
of Flanders, with the lords and ladies of their
Court, used to watch the tournaments and pageants
for which Bruges was celebrated, and in which
Maximilian was imprisoned by the burghers in
1488; and the Hôtel de Bouchoute, a narrow,
square building of dark red brick, with a gilded
lion over the doorway. But the Cranenburg, once
the 'most magnificent private residence in the
Market-Place,' many years ago lost every trace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
its original splendour, and is now an unattractive
hostelry, the headquarters of a smoking club; while
the Hôtel de Bouchoute, turned into a clothier's
shop, has little to distinguish it from its commonplace
neighbours. Nevertheless,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">'In the Market-Place of Bruges stands the Belfry old and brown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded, still it watches o'er the town.'</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It redeems the Market-Place from mediocrity.
How long ago the first belfry tower of Bruges
was built is unknown, but this at least is certain,
that in the year 1280 a fire, in which the ancient
archives of the town perished, destroyed the greater
part of an old belfry, which some suppose may have
been erected in the ninth century. On two subsequent
occasions, in the fifteenth and eighteenth
centuries, the present Belfry, erected on the ruins
of the former structure, was damaged by fire: and
now it stands on the south side of the Market-Place,
rising 350 feet above the Halles, a massive
building of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
solemn, weather-beaten, and majestic. 'For six
hundred years,' it has been said, 'this Belfry has
watched over the city of Bruges. It has beheld her
triumphs and her failures, her glory and her shame,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
her prosperity and her gradual decay, and, in spite
of so many vicissitudes, it is still standing to bear
witness to the genius of our forefathers, to awaken
memories of old times and admiration for one of
the most splendid monuments of civic architecture
which the Middle Ages has produced.'<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In olden times watchmen were always on duty
on the Belfry to give warning if enemies approached
or fire broke out in any part of the town, a constant
source of danger when most of the houses were
built of wood. Even in these more prosaic days
the custom of keeping watch and ward unceasingly
is still maintained, and if there is a fire, the alarum-bell
clangs over the city. All day, from year's end
to year's end, the chimes ring every quarter of an
hour; and all night, too, during the wildest storms
of winter, when the wind shrieks round the tower;
and in summer, when the old town lies slumbering
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>From the top of the Belfry one looks down on what is practically a mediæval city. </p>

<h3>BRUGES<br /><small>A corner of the Market on the Grand' Place.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_006fp.jpg" alt="BRUGES&mdash;A corner of the Market on the Grand' Place." width="600" height="436" /></div>

<p>The Market-Place seems to lose its modern aspect when seen
from above; and all round there is nothing visible
but houses with high-pointed gables and red roofs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
intersected by canals, and streets so narrow that
they appear to be mere lanes. Above these rise,
sometimes from trees and gardens, churches, convents,
venerable buildings, the lofty spire of Notre
Dame, the tower of St. Sauveur, the turrets of the
Gruthuise, the Hospital of St. John, famous for its
paintings by Memlinc, the Church of Ste. Elizabeth
in the grove of the Béguinage, the pinnacles of the
Palais du Franc, the steep roof of the Hôtel de
Ville, the dome of the Convent des Dames
Anglaises, and beyond that to the east the slender
tower which rises above the Guildhouse of the
Archers of St. Sebastian. The walls which guarded
Bruges in troublous times have disappeared, though
five of the old gateways remain; but the town is
still contained within the limits which it had
reached at the close of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Behind the large square of the Halles, from
which the Belfry rises, is the Rue du Vieux Bourg,
the street of the Ouden Burg, or old fort; and to
this street the student of history must first go if
he wishes to understand what tradition, more or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
less authentic, has to say about the earliest phases
in the strange, eventful past of Bruges. The wide
plain of Flanders, the northern portion of the
country which we now call Belgium, was in
ancient times a dreary fenland, the haunt of wild
beasts and savage men; thick, impenetrable forests,
tracts of barren sand, sodden marshes, covered it;
and sluggish streams, some whose waters never
found their way to the sea, ran through it. One
of these rivulets, called the Roya, was crossed by a
bridge, to defend which, according to early tradition,
a fort, or 'burg,' was erected in the fourth
century. This fort stood on an islet formed by the
meeting of the Roya with another stream, called
the Boterbeke, and a moat which joined the two.
We may suppose that near the fort, which was
probably a small building of rough stones, or
perhaps merely a wooden stockade, a few huts
were put up by people who came there for protection,
and as time went on the settlement
increased. 'John of Ypres, Abbot of St. Bertin,'
says Mr. Robinson, 'who wrote in the fourteenth
century, describes how Bruges was born and
christened: "Very soon pedlars began to settle
down under the walls of the fort to supply the
wants of its inmates. Next came merchants, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
their valuable wares. Innkeepers followed, who
began to build houses, where those who could not
find lodging in the fort found food and shelter.
Those who thus turned away from the fort would
say, 'Let us go to the bridge.' And when the
houses near the bridge became so numerous as to
form a town, it kept as its proper name the Flemish
word <i>Brugge</i>"'</p>

<p>The small island on which this primitive township
stood was bounded on the south and east by
the Roya, on the north by the Boterbeke, and on
the west by the moat joining these two streams.
The Roya still flows along between the site of the
old burg and an avenue of lime-trees called the
Dyver till it reaches the end of the Quai du
Rosaire, when it turns to the north. A short
distance beyond this point it is vaulted over, and
runs on beneath the streets and houses of the town.
The Rue du Vieux Bourg is built over the course
of the Boterbeke, which now runs under it and
under the Belfry (erected on foundations sunk deep
into the bed of the stream), until it joins the sub-terranean
channel of the Roya at the south-east
corner of the Market-Place. The moat which
joined these two streams and guarded the west
side of the island was filled up long ago, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
bed is now covered by the Rue Neuve, which
connects the Rue du Vieux Bourg with the Dyver.</p>

<p>Thus the boundaries of early Bruges can easily
be traced; but nothing remains of the ancient
buildings, though we read of a warehouse, booths,
and a prison besides the dwelling-houses of the
townsfolk. The elements, at least, of civic life
were there; and tradition says that in or near the
village, for it was nothing more, some altars of
the Christian faith were set up during the seventh
and eighth centuries. Trade, too, soon began to
flourish, and grew rapidly as the population of the
place increased. The Roya, flowing eastwards,
fell into the Zwijn, an arm of the sea, which then
ran up close to the town, and on which stood
Damme, now a small inland village, but once a
busy port crowded with shipping. The commercial
life of Bruges depended on the Zwijn;
and that much business was done before the close
of the ninth century is shown by the fact that
Bruges had then a coinage of its own.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>It was from such small beginnings that this famous
'Venice of the North' arose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>BALDWIN BRAS-DE-FER&mdash;THE PLACE DU BOURG&mdash;MURDER OF CHARLES THE GOOD</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">owards</span> the end of the ninth and at the beginning
of the tenth century great changes took
place on the banks of the Roya, and the foundations
of Bruges as we know it now were laid.
Just as in the memorable years 1814 and 1815
the empire of Napoleon fell into fragments, and
princes and statesmen hastened to readjust the
map of Europe in their own interests, so in the
ninth century the empire of Charlemagne was
crumbling away; and in the scramble for the
spoils, the Normans carried fire and sword into
Flanders. Charles the Bald, King of the Franks,
at this crisis called to his aid the strong arm of
Baldwin, a Flemish chief of whose ancestry we
know little, but who soon became famous as
Baldwin Bras-de-Fer&mdash;Baldwin of the Iron Arm,
so called because, in peace or war, he was never
seen without his coat of mail. This grim warrior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
had fallen in love with the daughter of Charles
the Bald, Judith, who had been already twice
married, first to the Saxon King Ethelwulf (after
the death of his first wife Osberga, mother of
Alfred the Great) and secondly to Ethelbald, on
whose death she left England and went to live
at Senlis. Baldwin persuaded the Princess to run
away with him; and they were married without
the knowledge of her father, to escape whose
vengeance the culprits fled to Rome. Pope
Nicholas I. brought about a reconciliation; and
Charles not only pardoned his son-in-law, but
appointed him ruler of Flanders under the title
of Marquis, which was afterwards changed into
that of Count. It is to the steel-clad Baldwin
Bras-de-Fer that the Counts of Flanders trace the
origin of their title; and he was, moreover, the
real founder of that Bruges which rose to such
glory in the Middle Ages, and is still, though fallen
from its high estate, the picturesque capital of West
Flanders, whither artists flock to wander about
amidst the canals and bridges, the dismantled
ramparts, the narrow streets with their curious
houses, and the old buildings which bear such
eloquent testimony to the ruin which long ago overtook
what was once an opulent and powerful city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
When the wrath of his father-in-law had been
appeased, Baldwin, now responsible for the defence
of Flanders, came to Bruges with his wife, and
there established his Court. But the old burg, it
seems, was not thought capable of holding out
against the Normans, who could easily land on
the banks of the Zwijn; and Baldwin, therefore,
set about building a new stronghold on the east
side of the old burg, and close to it. It was
surrounded partly by the main stream of the Roya,
and partly by backwaters flowing from it. Here
he built a fortress for himself and his household,
a church dedicated to St. Donatian, a prison, and
a 'ghiselhuis,' or house for the safe keeping of
hostages. The whole was enclosed by walls, built
close to the edge of the surrounding waters.</p>

<p>The Roya is now vaulted over where it ran
along the west side of Baldwin's stronghold,
separating it from the original burg, and the
watercourses which defended it on the north and
east are filled up; but the stream on the south
still remains in the shape of the canal which skirts
the Quai des Marbriers, from which a bridge leads
by a narrow lane, called the Rue de l'Âne Aveugle,
under an arch of gilded stonework, into the open
space now known as the Place du Bourg. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
we are at the very heart of Bruges, on the ground
where Baldwin's stronghold stood, with its four
gates and drawbridges, and the high walls frowning
above the homes of the townsmen clustering round
them. The aspect of the place is completely
changed since those early days. A grove of chestnut-trees
covers the site of the Church of St.
Donatian; not a stone remains of Bras-de-Fer's
rude palace; and instead of the prison and the
hostage-house, there are the Hôtel de Ville, now
more than five hundred years old, from whose
windows the Counts of Flanders swore obedience
to the statutes and privileges of the town, the
Palais de Justice, and the dark crypt beneath the
chapel which shelters the mysterious Relic of the
Holy Blood.</p>

<h3>BRUGES<br /><small>Rue de l'Âne Aveugle (showing end of Town Hall<br />
and Bridge connecting it with Palais de Justice).</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_014fp.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="361" height="600" /></div>

<p>In summer it is a warm, quiet, pleasant spot.
Under the shade of the trees, near the statue of
Van Eyck, women selling flowers sit beside rows
of geraniums, roses, lilies, pansies, which give a
touch of bright colour to the scene. Artists from
all parts of Europe set up their easels and paint.
Young girls are gravely busy with their water-colours.
Black-robed nuns and bare-footed Carmelites
pass silently along. Perhaps some traveller
from America opens his guide-book to study the map of
a city which had risen to greatness long before
Columbus crossed the seas.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
A few English people hurry across, and pass under the archway
of the Rue de l'Âne Aveugle on the way to their
tennis-ground beyond the Porte de Gand. The
sunshine glitters on the gilded façade of the Palais
de Justice, and lights up the statues in their niches
on the front of the Hôtel de Ville. There is no
traffic, no noise. Everything is still and peaceful.
The chimes, ever and anon ringing out from the
huge Belfry, which rises high above the housetops
to the west, alone break the silence.</p>

<p>This is Bruges sleeping peacefully in old age,
lulled to rest by the sound of its own carillon.
But it is easy, standing there, to recall the past,
and to fancy the scenes which took place from
time to time throughout the long period of foreign
danger and internal strife. We can imagine the
Bourg, now so peaceful, full of armed men, rushing
to the Church of St. Donatian on the morning
when Charles the Good was slain; how, in later
times, the turbulent burghers, fiery partisans of
rival factions, Clauwerts shouting for the Flemish
Lion, and Leliarts marshalled under the Lily of
France, raged and threatened; how the stones
were splashed with blood on the day of the Bruges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Matins, when so many Frenchmen perished; or
what shouts were raised when the Flemish host
came back victorious from the Battle of the
Golden Spurs.</p>

<p>Though every part of Bruges&mdash;not only the
Bourg, but the great Market-Place, and the whole
maze of streets and lanes and canals of which it
consists&mdash;has a story of its own, some of these
stories stand out by themselves; and amongst
these one of the most dramatic is the story of the
death of Charles the Good.</p>

<p>More than two hundred and fifty years had
passed away since the coming of Baldwin Bras-de-Fer;
Bruges had spread far beyond the walls
of the Bourg; and Charles, who had succeeded
his cousin Baldwin VII., was Count of Flanders.
He was called 'the Good' because of his just
rule and simple life, and still more, perhaps,
because he clothed and fed the poor&mdash;not only
in Bruges, but throughout all Flanders. The
common people loved him, but his charities gave
offence to the rich. He had, moreover, incurred
the special enmity of the Erembalds, a powerful
family, who, though not of noble origin themselves,
were connected by marriage with many noble
houses. They had supported his claim to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
throne of Flanders, which had been disputed, and
he had rewarded their services by heaping favours
on them. But, after a time, they began to oppose
the methods of government which Charles applied
to Flanders. They resented most of all one of
his decrees which made it unlawful for persons
not in his service to carry arms in time of peace.
This decree, which was pronounced in order to
prevent the daily scenes of violence which Charles
abhorred, was declared by the Erembalds to be
an interference with Flemish liberty. It did not
affect them personally, for they held office under
the Count; but they none the less opposed it
vehemently.</p>

<p>While Charles was thus on bad terms with the
Erembalds, a deadly feud existed between them
and the Straetens, another notable family, which
grew to such a height that the rival clans made
open war upon each other, pillaging, burning, and
slaying after the manner of these times. Charles
called the leaders of both sides before him, and
made them swear to keep the peace; but when
he was at Ypres in the autumn of 1126, a complaint
was laid before him that Bertulf, head
of the Erembalds, who was also Provost of St.
Donatian's, had sent one of his nephews, Burchard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
by name, on a raid into the lands of the Straetens,
whose cattle he had carried off. On hearing of
this outrage, Charles gave orders that Burchard's
house should be pulled down, and that he should
compensate the Straetens for their losses. The
Erembalds were powerless to resist this order,
and Burchard's house was razed to the ground.</p>

<p>It has been said that this was only the beginning
of strong measures which Charles was about to
take against the Erembalds; but there is no certainty
as to what his intentions really were. He
then lived in the Loove, a mansion which he had
built in the Bourg at Bruges, on the site now
occupied by the Palais de Justice; and there, on
his return from Ypres, he had a meeting with some
of the Erembalds, who had been sent to plead on
behalf of Burchard. As to what took place at this
interview there is some doubt. According to one
account, Charles drank wine with the delegates,
and granted a free pardon to Burchard, on condition
that he kept the peace. According to another
account, his demeanour was so unbending that the
Erembalds left his presence full of angry suspicions,
which they communicated to their friends. Whatever
may have happened, they were bent on
mischief. Burchard was sent for, and a secret consultation was held,
after which Burchard and a chosen few assembled in a house on the Bourg
and arranged their plans. This was on the night
of March 1, 1127.</p>

<h3>BRUGES<br /><small>Quai du Rosaire.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_018fp.jpg" alt="Quai du Rosaire." width="437"
height="600" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></div>

<p>At break of day next morning a cold, heavy
mist hung low over Bruges, and in the Bourg
everything was shrouded in darkness. But already
some poor men were waiting in the courtyard of
the Loove, to whom Charles gave alms on his way
to early Mass in the Church of St. Donatian. Then
he went along a private passage which led into the
church, and knelt in prayer before the Lady Altar.
It was his custom to give help to the needy when
in church, and he had just put some money into
the hands of a poor woman, when suddenly she
called out: 'Beware, Sir Count!' He turned
quickly round, and there, sword in hand, was
Burchard, who had stolen up the dim aisle to
where Charles was kneeling. The next moment
Burchard struck, and Charles fell dead upon the
steps of the altar.</p>

<p>Then followed a scene of wild confusion. The
woman ran out into the Bourg, calling loudly that
the Count was slain. In the midst of the uproar
some of the royal household fled in terror, while
others who entered the church were butchered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the Erembalds, who next attacked the Loove, and,
having pillaged it, rushed over Bruges, slaughtering
without mercy all who dared to oppose
them.</p>

<p>After some time one of the Count's servants
ventured to cover the dead body with a winding-sheet,
and to surround it with lighted tapers; and
there it remained lying on the pavement, until at
last the Erembalds, who were afraid to bury it in
Bruges lest the sight of the tomb of Charles the
Good should one day rouse the townsmen to
avenge his death, sent a message to Ghent, begging
the Abbot of St. Peter's to take it away and bury
it in his own church. The Abbot came to Bruges,
and before dawn the body of the murdered Count
was being stealthily carried along the aisles of
St. Donatian's, when a great crowd rushed in,
declaring that the bones of Charles must be
allowed to rest in peace at Bruges. The arches
rang with cries, chairs were overturned, stools and
candlesticks were thrown about, as the people,
pressing and struggling round the Abbot and his
servants, told Bertulf, with many an oath, that he
must yield to their wishes. At last the Provost
submitted, and on the morrow, just two days after
the murder, the body of Charles was buried before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the Lady Altar, on the very spot, it is said, where
the statue of Van Eyck now stands under the trees
in the Bourg.</p>

<p>The triumph of the Erembalds was short, for the
death of Charles the Good was terribly avenged by
his friends, who came to Bruges at the head of a
large force. A fierce struggle took place at the
Rue de l'Âne Aveugle, where many were slain.
The Erembalds were driven into the Bourg, the
gates of which they shut; but an entrance was
forced, and, after desperate fighting, some thirty of
them, all who remained alive, were compelled to
take refuge, first in the nave and then in the
tower of the Church of St. Donatian, where,
defending themselves with the courage of despair,
they made a last stand, until, worn out by fatigue
and hunger, they surrendered and came down.
Bertulf the Provost, Burchard, and a few of the
other ringleaders had fled some days before, and so
escaped, for a time at least, the fate of their companions,
who, having been imprisoned in a dungeon,
were taken to the top of the church tower and
flung down one by one on to the stones of the
Bourg. 'Their bodies,' says Mr. Gilliat-Smith,
'were thrown into a marsh beyond the village of
St. André, and for years afterwards no man after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
nightfall would willingly pass that way.' In the
Church of St. Sauveur there is a costly shrine containing
what are said to be the bones of Charles
the Good, taken from their first resting-place, at
which twice every year a festival is held in commemoration
of his virtues.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>THE BÉGUINAGE&mdash;CHURCHES&mdash;THE RELIC OF THE
HOLY BLOOD</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">B</span><span class="smcap">ruges</span> is one of the most Catholic towns in
Catholic Flanders. Convents and religious houses
of all sorts have always flourished there, and at
present there are no less than forty-five of these
establishments. Probably one of the most interesting
to English people is the Couvent des Dames
Anglaises, which was founded in 1629 by the
English Augustinian Nuns of Ste. Monica's Convent
at Louvain. Its chapel, with a fine dome of the
eighteenth century, contains a beautiful altar built
of marbles brought from Egypt, Greece, and
Persia; and amongst its possessions is the rosary
of Catherine of Braganza (Queen of Charles II. of
England), who died at Bruges.</p>

<p>And then there is the Béguinage. There are
Béguinages at Amsterdam and Breda, but with
this exception of Holland, Belgium is now the
only country in Europe where these societies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
origin of whose name is uncertain, are to be found.
They consist of spinsters or widows, who, though
bound by a few conventual oaths during their
connection with the society, may return to the
world. On entering each sister pays a sum of
money to the general funds, and at first lives for a
time along with other novices. At the end of this
term of probation they are at liberty to occupy
one of the small dwellings within the precincts of
the Béguinage, and keep house for themselves.
They spend their time in sewing, making lace,
educating poor children, visiting the sick, or any
form of good works for which they may have a
taste. They are under a Mother Superior, the
'Grande Dame,' appointed by the Bishop of the
diocese, and must attend the services in the church
of their Béguinage. Thus the Béguine, living
generally in a house of her own, and free to reenter
the world, occupies a different position from
the nuns of the better-known Orders, though so
long as she remains a member of her society she
is bound by the vows of chastity and obedience to
her ecclesiastical superiors.</p>

<h3>BRUGES<br /><small>The Béguinage.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_024fp.jpg" alt="The Béguinage." width="600"
height="466" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></div>

<p>The Béguinage at Bruges, founded in the thirteenth
century, is situated near the Minnewater,
or Lac d'Amour, which every visitor is taken to see.
This sheet of placid water, bordered by trees, which
was a harbour in the busy times, is one of the prettiest
bits of Bruges; and they say that if you go there
at midnight, and stand upon the bridge which crosses
it on the south, any wish which you may form will certainly
come to pass. It is better to go alone, for strict
silence is necessary to insure the working of this charm.
A bridge over the water which runs from the Lac d'Amour
leads through a gateway into the Béguinage, where
a circle of small houses&mdash;whitewashed, with stepped
gables, and green woodwork on the windows&mdash;surrounds
a lawn planted with tall trees. There
is a view of the spire of Notre Dame beyond the
roofs, a favourite subject for the painters who come
here in numbers on summer afternoons. The
Church of Ste. Elizabeth, an unpretentious building,
stands on one side of the lawn; and within it,
many times a day, the Sisters may be seen on their
knees repeating the Offices of the Church. When
the service is finished they rise, remove their white
head-coverings, and return demurely to their quaint
little homes.</p>

<p>Bruges has, needless to say, many churches, but
nothing which can be compared to the magnificent
Cathedral of Antwerp, to the imposing front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Ste. Gudule at Brussels, or to the huge mass which
forms such a conspicuous landmark for several
leagues round Malines. Still, some of the churches
are not without interest: the Cathedral of St.
Sauveur, where the stalls of the Knights of the
Order of the Golden Fleece, which was founded
at Bruges, are to be seen in the choir, and over
one of them the arms of Edward IV. of England;
the curious little Church of Jerusalem, with its
'Holy Sepulchre,' an exact copy of the traditionary
grave in Palestine&mdash;a dark vault, entered by a
passage so low that one must crawl through it, and
where a light burns before a figure which lies there
wrapped in a linen cloth; and the Church of
Notre Dame, which contains some treasures, such
as a lovely white marble statue of the Virgin and
Child, from the chisel of Michael Angelo; the tombs
of Charles the Bold of Burgundy and his daughter&mdash;the
'Gentle Mary,' whose untimely death at Bruges
in 1482, after a short married life, saved her from
witnessing the misfortunes which clouded the last
years of her husband, the Archduke Maximilian;
and a portion of the Holy Cross, which came to
Bruges in the fifteenth century. The story goes
that a rich merchant, a Dutchman from Dordrecht,
Schoutteeten by name, who lived at Bruges, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
travelling through Syria in the year 1380. One
day, when journeying with a caravan, he saw a
man hiding something in a wood, and, following
him, discovered that it was a box, which he suspected
might contain something valuable. Mijnheer
Schoutteeten appropriated the box, and carried
it home from Syria to Dordrecht, where a series
of miracles began to occur of such a nature as to
make it practically certain that the box (or some
wood which it contained, for on this point the
legend is vague) was a part of the true Cross!
In course of time Schoutteeten died in the odour
of sanctity, having on his death-bed expressed a
wish that the wood which he had brought from
the East should be given to the Church of Notre
Dame at Bruges. His widow consoled herself by
taking a second husband, who, Uutenhove by name,
fulfilled the pious request of his predecessor, and
thus another relic was added to the large collection
which is preserved in the various churches and
religious houses of Bruges. It was brought to
Flanders in the year 1473, and must have been a
source of considerable revenue to the Church since
then.</p>

<p>The buildings of Notre Dame, with the well-known
Gruthuise Mansion which adjoins them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and the singularly graceful spire, higher than the
Belfry tower, rising from the exquisite portico
called 'Het Paradijs,' form a very beautiful group;
but, with this exception, there is nothing remarkable
about the churches of Bruges. One of them,
however, has a peculiar interest&mdash;the Chapelle du
Saint-Sang, which stands in the Place du Bourg in
the corner next to the Hôtel de Ville. It is built
in two stories. The lower, a dark, solemn chapel,
like a crypt, was dedicated to St. Basil at an early
period, and is one of the oldest buildings in
Bruges. The greater part of the upper story
does not date further back than the fifteenth
century. But it is not the fabric itself, venerable
though that is, but what it contains, that makes this
place the Holy of Holies in the religious life of
Bruges; for here, in a costly shrine of gold and
silver adorned with precious stones, they guard the
wonderful relic which was brought from Palestine
in the time of the Crusaders by Thierry d'Alsace,
Count of Flanders, and which is still worshipped
by thousands of devout believers every year.</p>

<p>Thierry d'Alsace, the old chroniclers tell us,
visited the Holy Land four times, and was the
leader of the Flemish warriors who, roused by the
eloquence of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
second Crusade in the summer of 1147. He had
married Sybilla, sister of Baldwin, King of Jerusalem;
and when the time came for his return
to Europe, his brother-in-law and the Patriarch of
Jerusalem resolved to reward his services by giving
him a part of the most valuable relic which the
Church in Palestine possessed, which was a small
quantity of a red liquid, said to be blood and
water, which, according to immemorial tradition,
Joseph of Arimathæa had preserved after he had
washed the dead body of Jesus.</p>

<p>The earlier history of this relic is unknown, and
is as obscure as that of the other 'Relics of the
Holy Blood' which are to be found in various
places. But there can be no doubt whatever that
in the twelfth century the Christians at Jerusalem
believed that it had been in existence since the day
of the Crucifixion. It was, therefore, presented to
Thierry with great solemnity in the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre during the Christmas festivals
of 1148. The Patriarch, having displayed the
vessel which contained it to the people, divided
the contents into two portions, one of which he
poured into a small vial, the mouth of which was
carefully sealed up and secured with gold wire.
This vessel was next enclosed in a crystal tube,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
shut at the ends with golden stoppers, to which
a chain of silver was attached. Then the Patriarch
gave the tube to Baldwin, from whose hands
Thierry, kneeling on the steps of the altar, received
it with profound emotion.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Count, however, did not think his hands,
which had shed so much human blood, worthy to
convey the relic home; and he entrusted it to
Leonius, chaplain of the Flemish Army, who hung
it round his neck, and so carried it to Bruges,
where he arrived in May, 1150, along with Thierry,
who, mounted on a white horse led by two barefooted
monks, and holding the relic in his hand,
was conducted in state to the Bourg, where he
deposited the precious object in the Chapel of
St. Basil, which is commonly known as the Chapel
of the Holy Blood.</p>

<p>After some time the relic was found to be dry,
but, strange to say, it became liquid, we are told
upon the authority of Pope Clement V., every
Friday, 'usually at six o'clock.' This weekly
miracle continued till about the year 1325. Since
then it has never taken place except once, in 1388,
when the vial containing the relic was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
transferred to a new crystal tube; and on this occasion
William, Bishop of Ancona, was astonished to see
the relic turning redder than usual, and some drops,
as of newly-shed blood, flowing within the vial,
which he was holding in his hand. Many notable
persons who were present, one of them the Bishop
of Lincoln, testified to this event!</p>

<p>Other miracles wrought through the agency of
this relic are recorded. A child which had been
born dead was taken to the shrine, and came to
life after three days. A young girl who had
suffered for twenty months from an issue of blood,
and for whom the doctors could do nothing, was
cured by the application of a piece of cloth which
had been used to cover the relic. Another girl
who had been paralyzed for a long time, being
carried into the Chapel of St. Basil, was restored
to complete strength the moment she kissed the
crystal tube. In December, 1689, a fire broke out
in the Bourg, and threatened to destroy the Hôtel
de Ville; but a priest brought forth the tube containing
the relic, and held it up before the flames,
which were instantly extinguished. These and
many other similar miracles, confirmed by the
oath of witnesses and received by the Church at
the present day as authentic, make the relic an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
object of profound devotion to the people of
Bruges and the peasants of the surrounding
country, who go in crowds to bow before it
twice every Friday, when it is exhibited for public
worship.</p>

<p>It was nearly lost on several occasions in the
days of almost constant war, and during the
French Revolution it was concealed for some years
in the house of a private citizen. The Chapel of
St. Basil suffered from the disturbed condition of
the country, and when Napoleon came to Bruges
in 1810 it was such a complete wreck that the
magistrates were on the point of sweeping it away
altogether. But Napoleon saved it, declaring that
when he looked on the ruins he fancied himself
once more amongst the antiquities of Egypt, and
that to destroy them would be a crime. Four
years after the Battle of Waterloo the relic was
brought out from its hiding-place, and in 1856 the
chapel was restored from the designs of two
English architects, William Brangwyn and Thomas
Harper King.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>On the first Monday after the 2nd of May every
year the town of Bruges is full of strangers, who
have come to witness the celebrated 'Procession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of the Holy Blood,' which there is good reason to
believe has taken place annually (except during the
French Revolution) for the last 755 years.</p>

<p>Very early in the day a Mass is celebrated in
the Upper Chapel of the Holy Blood, which is
crowded to the doors. In the crypt, or lower
chapel, where many people are kneeling before the
sacred images, the gloom, the silence, the bent
figures dimly seen in the faint yellow light of a
few tapers, make up a weird scene all the morning
till about nine o'clock, when the relic, in its
'châsse,' or tabernacle, is carried to the Cathedral
of St. Sauveur, and placed on the high altar,
while a pontifical Mass is celebrated by one of the
Bishops. When that is done, the procession starts
on its march along the chief thoroughfares of the
town. The houses are decorated with flags, and
candles burn in almost every window. Through
the narrow streets, between crowds of people standing
on the pavements or looking down from the
windows, while the church bells ring and wreaths
of incense fill the air, bands of music, squadrons of
cavalry, crucifixes, shrines, images, the banners of
the parishes and the guilds, heralds in their varied
dresses, bareheaded pilgrims from England, France,
and other countries, pages, maidens in white, bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
palms, or crowns of thorn, or garlands, priests
with relics, acolytes and chanting choristers, pass
slowly along. The buffoonery of the Middle Ages,
when giants, ballet-dancers, and mythological
characters figured in the scene, has been abandoned;
but Abraham and Isaac, King David and King
Solomon, Joseph and the Virgin Mary, the Magi,
and many saints and martyrs, walk in the long
procession, which is closed by the Bishops and
clergy accompanying the gorgeous shrine containing
the small tube of something red like blood, before
which all the people sink to the ground, and remain
kneeling till it has passed.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the day end with a benediction
at an altar erected in front of the Hôtel de
Ville. The Bourg is filled from side to side with
those who have taken part in the procession, and
by thousands of spectators who have followed them
from all parts of the town to witness the closing
scene. The crowd gathers under the trees and
along the sides of the square, the centre of which,
occupied by the processionists, is a mass of colour,
above which the standards and images which have
been carried through the streets rise against the
dark background of the Hôtel de Ville and the
Chapel of the Holy Blood. The relic is taken out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of the châsse, and a priest, standing on the steps of
the altar high above the crowd, holds it up to be
worshipped. Everyone bows low, and then, in
dead silence, the mysterious object is carried into
the chapel, and with this the chief religious ceremony
of the year at Bruges is brought to a
close.</p>

<p>There are sights in Bruges that night, within a
stone's-throw of the Chapel of the Holy Blood,
which are worth seeing, they contrast so strangely
with all this fervour of religion.</p>

<p>The curtain has fallen upon the drama of the
day. The flags are furled and put aside. The
vestments are in the sacristy. Shrines, canopies,
censers, all the objects carried in the procession,
have disappeared into the churches. The church
doors are locked, and the images are left to stand
all night without so much as one solitary worshipper
kneeling before them. The Bourg is empty and
dark, steeped in black shadows at the door of the
chapel where the relic has been laid to rest. It
is all quiet there, but a stroll through the Rue de
l'Âne Aveugle and across the canal by the bridge
which leads to the purlieus of the fish-markets
brings one upon another scene. Every second house,
if not every house, is a café, 'herberg,' or 'estaminet,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
with a bar and sanded floor and some rough
chairs and tables; and on the night of the Procession
of the Holy Blood they are crowded to the
doors. Peasants from the country are there in
great force. For some days before and after the
sacred festival the villagers are in the habit of
coming into Bruges&mdash;whole families of them,
father and mother, sons and daughters, all in their
best finery. They walk through the streets, following
the route by which the Holy Blood is carried,
telling their beads and saying their prayers, crossing
themselves, and kneeling at any image of Christ, or
Madonna, or saint, which they may notice at the
street corners. It is curious to watch their sunburnt
faces and uncouth ways as they slouch along,
their hands busy with their beads, and their lips
never ceasing for a moment to mutter prayer after
prayer. They follow in the wake of the Procession
of the Holy Blood, or wait to fall upon their
knees when it passes and receive the blessing
of the Bishop, who walks with fingers raised,
scattering benedictions from side to side. In the
evening, before starting for home, they go to the
cafés.</p>

<p>As evening passes into night the sounds of music
and dancing are heard. At the doors people sit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
drinking round tables placed on the pavement or
in the rank, poisonous gutter. The hot air is
heavy with the smell of decayed fish. Inside the
cafés men and women, old and young, are dancing
in the fetid atmosphere to jingling pianos or
accordions. The heat, the close, sour fumes of
musty clothing, tobacco, beer, gin, fried fish, and
unwashed humanity, are overpowering. There are
disgusting sights in all directions. Fat women,
with red, perspiring faces and dirty fingers, still
clutching their rosaries; tawdry girls, field-workers,
with flushed faces, dancing with country lads, most
of whom are more than half tipsy; ribald jokes
and laughter and leering eyes; reeling, drunken
men; maudlin affection in one corner, and jealous
disputing in another; crying babies; beer and gin
spilt on the tables; and all sorts of indecency and
hideous details which Swift might have gloated
over or Hogarth painted.</p>

<p>This is how the day of the Holy Blood procession
is finished by many of the countryfolk. The
brutal cabaret comes after the prayers and adoration
of the morning! It is a world of contrasts.
But soon the lights are out, the shutters are put
up, the last customer goes staggering homewards,
and the Belfry speaks again, as it spoke when

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>THE BRUGES MATINS&mdash;BATTLE OF THE GOLDEN SPURS</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> visitor to Bruges is reminded, wherever he
goes, of the stirring events which fill the chronicles
of the town for several centuries. Opposite the
Belfry, in the middle of the Market-Place, is the
monument to Peter De Coninck and John Breidel, on
which garlands of flowers are laid every summer, in
memory of what they did when the burghers rose
against the French in May, 1302; and amongst the
modern frescoes which cover the walls of the
Grande Salle des Échevins in the Hôtel de Ville,
with its roof of fourteenth-century woodwork, is
one which represents the return from the Battle of
the Golden Spurs, that famous fight in which the
hardy peasantry of Flanders overthrew the knights
of France whom Philip the Fair had sent to avenge
the blood of the Frenchmen who had died on the
terrible morning of the 'Bruges Matins.'</p>

<p>The fourteenth century had opened. The town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
had now reached the limits which have contained
it ever since&mdash;an irregular oval with a circumference
of between four and five miles, surrounded by double
ditches, and a strong wall pierced by nine fortified
gateways; and as the town had grown, the privileges
and liberties of the townsmen had grown likewise.
Sturdy, independent, and resolved to keep the management
of their own affairs in their own hands, the
burghers of Bruges, like those of the other Flemish
towns, had succeeded in establishing a system of self-government
so complete that it roused the opposition
of Guy de Dampierre, Count of Flanders, whose
efforts to diminish the power of these communities
at length brought about a crisis which gave Philip
the Fair of France an excuse for interfering. The
Count, having to contend both against his own
subjects and against the ambitions of the King of
France, fell from power, and in the end Flanders
was annexed to France.</p>

<p>Soon after this rich province had been added to
his domains, Philip came with his wife, Joanna of
Navarre, on a visit to Bruges. Already there were
two factions in the town&mdash;the Leliarts, or French
party, consisting chiefly of the upper classes, and
the Clauwerts, or Flemish party, to which the mass
of the people belonged. By the former Philip was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
received in royal fashion, and so magnificent were
the dresses and jewels worn by the wives and
daughters of the nobles and rich burgesses, who
sat in the windows and balconies as the royal procession
passed along, that the Queen was moved
to jealousy. 'I thought,' she said, 'that I alone
was Queen; but here in this place I have six
hundred rivals.' But in the streets below there
were sullen looks and murmurs of discontent,
which grew louder and louder every day, when,
after the departure of the Court, the magistrates,
who belonged to the French party, proposed that
the merchant guilds should find money to defray
some of the expenses which had been incurred on
this occasion.</p>

<p>At this time Peter De Coninck was Dean of the
Guild of Weavers, a man of substance, popular and
eloquent. There was a tumultuous gathering in
the Market-Place, when, standing in front of the
Belfry, with the leaders of five-and-twenty guilds
around him, he declaimed on liberty, and attacked
the magistrates, calling on his fellow-townsmen to
resist the taxes. The city officers, on the order of
the magistrates, arrested De Coninck and his chief
supporters, and hurried them to the prison in the
Bourg. But in a few hours the mob forced an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
entrance and released them. The signal for revolt
had been given, and for some months Bruges, like
the rest of Flanders, was in disorder. De Coninck,
who had been joined by John Breidel, Dean of the
Guild of Butchers, was busy rousing the people in all
parts of the country. He visited Ghent, amongst
other places, and tried to persuade the magistrates
that if Ghent and Bruges united their forces the
whole Flemish people would rise, crush the Leliarts,
and expel the French. But the men of Ghent
would not listen to him, and he returned to Bruges.
Here, too, he met with a rebuff, for the magistrates,
having heard that Jacques de Châtillon,
whom Philip had made Governor of Flanders, was
marching on the town, would not allow him to
remain amongst them. He went to Damme, and
with him went, not only Breidel, but 5,000 burghers
of the national party, stout Clauwerts, who had
devoted themselves to regaining the liberty of their
country.</p>

<h3>A FLEMISH YOUNG WOMAN</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_042fp.jpg" alt="A FLEMISH YOUNG WOMAN" width="452"
height="600" /></div>

<p>When Châtillon rode up to the walls of Bruges
and demanded entrance the magistrates agreed to
open the gates, on condition that he brought with
him only 300 men-at-arms. But he broke his
word, and the town was entered by 2,000 knights,
whose haughty looks and threatening language
convinced the people that treachery was intended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
It was whispered in the Market-Place that the
waggons which rumbled over the drawbridges
carried ropes with which the Clauwerts who had
remained in the town were to be hanged; that there
was to be a general massacre, in which not even
the women and children would be spared; and that
the Frenchmen never unbuckled their swords or
took off their armour, but were ready to begin the
slaughter at any moment. It was a day of terror
in Bruges, and when evening came some of the
burghers slipped out, made their way to Damme,
and told De Coninck what was passing in the town.</p>

<p>That night Châtillon gave a feast to his chief
officers, and amongst his guests was Pierre Flotte,
Chancellor of France, perhaps the ablest of those
jurists by whose evil councils Philip the Fair was
encouraged in the ideas of autocracy which led him
to make the setting up of a despotism the policy of
his whole life. With Flotte&mdash;'that Belial,' as Pope
Boniface VIII. once called him&mdash;and the rest,
Châtillon sat revelling till a late hour. The night
wore on; De Châtillon's party broke up, and went
to rest; the weary sentinels were half asleep at
their posts; and soon all Bruges was buried in
silence. Here and there lights twinkled in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the guild-houses, where a few of the burghers
sat anxiously waiting for what the morrow might
bring forth, while others went to the ramparts on
the north, and strained their eyes to see if help was
coming from Damme.</p>

<p>At early dawn&mdash;it was Friday, May 18, 1302&mdash;the
watchers on the ramparts saw a host of armed
men rapidly approaching the town. They were
divided into two parties, one of which, led by
De Coninck, made for the Porte Ste. Croix, while
the other, under Breidel, marched to the Porte de
Damme, a gateway which no longer exists, but
which was then one of the most important entrances,
being that by which travellers came from
Damme and Sluis. Messengers from the ramparts
ran swiftly through the streets, in which daylight
was now beginning to appear, and spread the news
from house to house. Silently the burghers took
their swords and pikes, left their homes, and
gathered in the Market-Place and near the houses
in which the French were sleeping. The French
slept on till, all of a sudden, they were wakened
by the tramp of feet, the clash of arms, and shouts
of 'Flanders for the Lion!' Breidel had led his
men into the town, and they were rushing through
the streets to where Châtillon had taken up his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
quarters, while De Coninck, having passed through
the Porte Ste. Croix, was marching to the Bourg.
The Frenchmen, bewildered, surprised, and only
half awake, ran out into the streets. The Flemings
were shouting 'Schilt ende Vriendt! Schilt ende
Vriendt!'<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and every man who could not pronounce these words was known to be a Frenchman, and
slain upon the spot. Some fled to the gates; but
at every gate they found a band of guards, who
called out 'Schilt ende Vriendt!' and put them to
the sword.</p>

<p>All that summer's morning, and on throughout
the day, the massacre continued. Old men, women,
and children hurled stones from the roofs and windows
down upon the enemy. Breidel, a man of
great strength, killed many with his own hand, and
those whom he wounded were beaten to death
where they fell by the apprentices with their iron
clubs. In the Market-Place, close to where the
monument to De Coninck and Breidel stands, a
party of soldiers, under a gallant French knight,
Gauthier de Sapignies, made a stand; but they
were overpowered and slaughtered to the last man.
Châtillon tried to rally his forces, but the surprise
had been too complete, and, disguising himself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the cassock of a priest, he hid, in company with
Chancellor Flotte, till it was dark, when they
managed to escape from the town. By this time
the carnage had ceased; the walls of the houses
and the gutters ran with blood; and the burghers
of Bruges had done their work so thoroughly that
2,000 Frenchmen lay dead upon the streets.</p>

<p>But the final reckoning with France was yet to
come. When Châtillon reached Paris and told his
master the direful story of the Bruges Matins,
Philip swore revenge; and a few weeks later an
army 40,000 strong invaded Flanders, under the
Comte d'Artois, with whom rode also Châtillon,
Flotte, and many nobles of France. The Flemings
went to meet them&mdash;not only the burghers of
Bruges, led by De Coninck and Breidel, marching
under the banners of their guilds, but men from
every part of Flanders&mdash;and on July 11, near
Courtrai, the Battle of the Golden Spurs was
fought.</p>

<h3>A FLEMISH BURGHER</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_046fp.jpg" alt="A FLEMISH BURGHER" width="467"
height="600" /></div>

<p>The ground was marshy, with a stream and pools
of water between the two armies; and just as the
Scots at Bannockburn, twelve years afterwards,
prepared pitfalls for the heavy cavalry of England,
so the Flemings laid a trap for the French knights
by cutting down brushwood and covering the water.
The horsemen, clad in cumbrous armour, charged,
the brushwood gave way, and most of them sank into
the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47-48]</a></span>
The Comte d'Artois got clear, but was beaten to
the ground and killed. The Chancellor Flotte,
who had boasted that he would bring the people
of Bruges to their knees, was trampled to death.
Châtillon died too; and when, at last, a long day's
fighting came to an end, the Flemings had gained a
complete victory. By this battle, which took its name from the thousands
of golden spurs which were torn from the French
knights who fell, the victors secured&mdash;for a time, at
least&mdash;the liberty of their country, and the memory
of it was for many a day to Flanders what the
memory of Bannockburn was to Scotland or of
Morgarten to Switzerland.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>DAMME&mdash;THE SEA-FIGHT AT SLUIS&mdash;SPLENDOUR OF
BRUGES IN THE MIDDLE AGES&mdash;<br />THE FALL AND
LOSS OF TRADE</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">D</span><span class="smcap">amme</span>, where the patriots mustered on the eve of
the Bruges Matins, is within a short hour's stroll
from the east end of the town. The Roya, which
disappears from view, as we have already seen,
opposite the Quai du Rosaire, emerges from its
hidden course at the west end of the Quai du
Miroir, where the statue of Jan van Eyck stands
near the door of the building now used as a public
library. This building was once the Customs House
of Bruges, conveniently situated in the neighbourhood
of the Market-Place, and on the side of the
Roya, which thence stretches eastwards between
the Quai du Miroir and the Quai Spinola for a few
hundred yards, and then turns sharply to the north,
and continues between the Quai Long and the
Quai de la Potterie, which are built in rambling
fashion on either side of the water. Some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
houses are old, others of no earlier date, apparently,
than the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries; some
large and well preserved, and some mere cottages,
half ruinous, with low gables and faded yellow
fronts, huddled together on the rough causeway,
alongside of which are moored canal-boats with
brown hulls and deck-houses gay with white and
green paint. At the end of the Quai de la Potterie
is the modern Bassin de Commerce, in which the
Roya loses itself, the harbour for the barges and
small steamers which come by the canal connecting
Ostend with Bruges and Ghent; and near this
was, in ancient days, the Porte de Damme, through
which Breidel and his followers burst on that fateful
morning in May 600 years ago.</p>

<p>To the right of the Bassin a broad canal, constructed
by Napoleon in 1810, extends in a straight
line eastwards, contained within dykes which raise
it above a wide expanse of level meadow-lands intersected
by ditches, and dotted here and there by the
white-walled cottages with red roofs and green
outside shutters which are so typical of Flemish
scenery. About two miles out of Bruges one comes
in sight of a windmill perched on a slope at the side
of the canal, a square church-tower, a few houses,
and some grassy mounds, which were once strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
fortifications. Even the historical imagination, which
everyone who walks round Bruges must carry with
him, is hardly equal to realizing that this was once
a bustling seaport, with a harbour in which more
than a hundred merchant ships, laden with produce
from all parts of the world, were sometimes lying
at the same time. In those busy times Damme,
they say, contained 50,000 inhabitants; now there
are only about 1,100.</p>

<p>Beyond Damme the canal winds on through the
same flat landscape, low-lying, water-logged, with
small farmhouses and scanty trees, and in the distance,
on the few patches of higher ground, the
churches of Oostkerke and Westcapelle. At last,
soon after passing the Dutch frontier, the canal
ends in a little dock with gray, lichen-covered sides;
and this is Sluis, a dull place, with a few narrow
streets, a market-place, two churches, and a belfry
of the fourteenth century. It is quite inland now,
miles from the salt water; and from the high
ramparts which still surround it the view extends
to the north across broad green fields, covering
what was once the bed of the sea, in the days
when the tide ebbed and flowed in the channel of
the Zwijn, over which ships passed sailing on their
way to Bruges. But any English traveller who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
having gone a little way out of the beaten track of
summer tourists, may chance to mount the ramparts,
and look down upon the fields which stretch away
to the shores of the North Sea and the estuary of
the Scheldt, and inland beyond Damme to the
Belfry and the spires of Bruges, is gazing on
the scene of a great event in the naval history
of England.</p>

<p>Here, on what is now dry land, on the morning
of June 24, 1340, 800 ships of war, full of armed
men&mdash;35,000 of them&mdash;were drawn up in line of
battle; and further out to sea, beyond the entrance
of the Zwijn, the newly-risen sun was shining on
the sails of another fleet which was man&oelig;uvring in
the offing.</p>

<p>'In the cities of Flanders,' says Dr. Gardiner,
'had arisen manufacturing populations which supplied
the countries round with the products of the
loom. To the Ghent and Bruges of the Middle
Ages England stood in the same relation as that
which the Australian colonies hold to the Leeds
and Bradford of our own day. The sheep which
grazed over the wide, unenclosed pasture-lands of
our island formed a great part of the wealth of
England, and that wealth depended entirely on
the flourishing trade with the Flemish towns in
which English wool was converted into cloth.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
When, therefore, Edward III. claimed the throne
of France, and the Hundred Years' War began, it
was of vital importance to the trade of Flanders
and England that the merchants of the two countries
should maintain friendly relations with each
other. But Philip of Valois had persuaded the
Count of Flanders, Louis de Nevers, to order the
arrest of all the English in Flanders, and Edward
had retaliated by arresting all the Flemings who
were in England, and forbidding the export of
English wool to Flanders. The result was that
the weavers of Bruges and the other manufacturing
towns of Flanders found themselves on the road to
ruin; and, having no interest in the question at
issue between the Kings of France and England,
apart from its effect on their commercial prosperity,
the burghers of Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres, under
the leadership of the famous Jacob van Artevelde
(anticipating, as one of the modern historians of
Bruges has noticed, what the Great Powers did for
Belgium in 1830<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>), succeeded in securing, with the assent of Philip, the neutrality of Flanders. The
French King, however, did not keep faith with
the Flemings, but proceeded to acts of aggression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
against them, and a league against France was
formed between England and Flanders.</p>

<p>In June, 1340, Edward, who was then in England,
hearing that an immense number of French ships
of war were at anchor in the Zwijn, set sail to give
them battle with a squadron of 300 vessels. The
English fleet anchored off the coast between Blankenberghe
and Heyst on the evening of June 23,
and from the top of the dunes the English scouts
saw in the distance the masts of the French ships
in the Zwijn.</p>

<p>As soon as there was light next morning, the
English weighed anchor and sailed along the coast
to the east; past lonely yellow sands, which have
swarmed during recent years with workmen toiling
at the construction of the immense harbour of See-Brugge,
which is to be the future port of Bruges; past
what was then the small fishing hamlet of Heyst;
past a range of barren dunes, amongst which to-day
Duinbergen, the latest of the Flemish watering-places,
with its spacious hotel and trim villas, is
being laid out; past a waste of storm-swept sand
and rushes, on which are now the digue of Knocke,
a cluster of hotels and crowded lodging-houses, and
a golf-course; and so onwards till they opened the
mouth of the Zwijn, and saw the French ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
crowding the entrance, 'their masts appearing to
be like a great wood,' and beyond them the walls
of Sluis rising from the wet sands left by the receding
tide.</p>

<p>It was low-water, and while waiting for the turn
of the tide the English fleet stood out to sea for
some time, so that Nicholas Béhuchet, the French
Admiral, began to flatter himself that King Edward,
finding himself so completely outnumbered, would
not dare to risk fighting against such odds. The
odds, indeed, were nearly three to one against the
English seamen; but as soon as the tide began to
flow they steered straight into the channel, and,
Edward leading the van, came to close quarters,
ship to ship. The famous archers of England, who
six years later were to do such execution at Crécy
lined the bulwarks, and poured in a tempest of
arrows so thick that men fell from the tops of the
French ships like leaves before a storm. The first
of the four lines in which Béhuchet had drawn
up his fleet was speedily broken, and the English,
brandishing their swords and pikes, boarded the
French ships, drove their crews overboard, and
hoisted the flag of England. King Edward was
wounded, and the issue may have been doubtful,
when suddenly more ships, coming from the North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of England, appeared in sight, and hordes of
Flemings from all parts of Flanders, from the
coast, and even from inland towns so far away as
Ypres,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
came swarming in boats to join in the
attack. This decided the fate of the great battle,
which continued till sunset. When it ended, the
French fleet had ceased to exist, with the exception
of a few ships which escaped when it was
dark. The Flemings captured Béhuchet, and
hung him then and there. Nearly 30,000 of his
men perished, many of whom were drowned while
attempting to swim ashore, or were clubbed to
death by the Flemings who lined the beach, waiting
to take vengeance on the invaders for having
burned their homesteads and carried off their flocks.
The English lost two ships and 4,000 men; but
the victory was so complete that no courtier was
bold enough to carry the news to King Philip,
who did not know what had befallen his great fleet
till the Court jester went to him, and said, 'Oh!
the English cowards! the English cowards! they
had not the courage to jump into the sea as our
noble Frenchmen did at Sluis.'</p>

<p>It is strange to think that Flemish peasants
work, and cattle feed, and holiday visitors from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Knocke, or Sluis, or Kadzand ramble about dry-shod
where the waves were rolling in on that
midsummer's morning, and that far beneath the
grass the timbers of so many stout ships and
the bones of so many valiant seamen have long
since mouldered away. And it is also strange to
think, when wandering along the canals of Bruges,
where now the swans glide silently about in the
almost stagnant water which laps the basements
of the old houses, how in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries ships of every nation carried in
great bales of merchandise, and that rich traders
stored them in warehouses and strong vaults, which
are now mere coal-cellars, or the dark and empty
haunts of the rats which swarm in the canals.</p>

<p>'There is,' says Mr. Robinson, 'in the National
Library at Paris a list of the kingdoms and cities
which sent their produce to Bruges at that time.
England sent wool, lead, tin, coal, and cheese;
Ireland and Scotland, chiefly hides and wool;
Denmark, pigs; Russia, Hungary, and Bohemia,
large quantities of wax; Poland, gold and silver;
Germany, wine; Liége, copper kettles; and Bulgaria,
furs.' After naming many parts of Europe,
Asia, and Africa, that sent goods, the manuscript
adds: 'And all the aforesaid realms and regions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
send their merchants with wares to Flanders,
besides those who come from France, Poitou, and
Gascony, and from the three islands of which we
know not the names of their kingdoms.' The trade
of Bruges was enormous. People flocked there from
all quarters.</p>

<p class="center">
'Lombard and Venetian merchants with deep-laden argosies;<br />
Ministers from twenty nations; more than royal pomp and ease.'</p>

<p>We read of 150 ships entering in one day,
and of German merchants buying 2,600 pieces
of cloth, made by Flemish weavers, in a morning's
marketing. A citizen of Bruges was always at the
head of the Hanseatic League, and maintained the
rights of that vast commercial society under the
title of 'Comte de la Hanse.' Merchant princes,
members of the Hanse, lived here in palaces.
Money-changers grew rich. Edward III. borrowed
from the Bardi at Bruges on the security of the
Crown jewels of England. Contracts of insurance
against maritime risks were entered into from an
early period, and the merchant shipping code which
regulated traffic by sea was known as the 'Röles
de Damme.'<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
There were twenty consulates at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
one time in Bruges, and the population of the town
is said, though it is difficult to believe that this is
not an exaggeration, to have been more than 200,000
before the middle of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Six years after the Battle of Sluis, Louis of
Nevers was killed at Crecy, and his son, Louis of
Maele, reigned in his stead as Count of Flanders.
He was a Leliart to the core, and his reign of
nearly forty years, one long struggle against the
liberties of his people, witnessed the capture of
Bruges by Philip van Artevelde, the invasion of
Flanders by the French, the defeat of the Nationalists,
and the death of Van Artevelde on the field
of Roosebeke. Nevertheless, during this period
and after it Bruges grew in beauty and in wealth.
The Hôtel de Ville, without the grandeur of the
Hôtel de Ville at Brussels, but still a gem of
mediæval architecture, was built on the site of the
old 'Ghiselhuis' of Baldwin Bras-de-Fer. Other
noble buildings, rich in design and beautiful in
all their outlines, and great mansions, with marble
halls and ceilings of exquisitely carved woodwork,
rose on every side; towers and pinnacles,
shapely windows and graceful arches, overhung the
waterways; luxury increased; in the homes of
the nobles and wealthy merchants were stores of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
precious stones, tapestries, silk, fine linen, cloth
of gold; the churches and many buildings gleamed
with gilded stone and tinted glass and brilliant
frescoes. Art flourished as the town grew richer.
The elder and the younger Van Eyck, Gerard
David, and Memlinc, with many others before and
after them, were attracted by its splendour, as
modern painters have been attracted by its decay;
and though the 'Adoration of the Immaculate
Lamb' hangs in the choir of St. Bavon at Ghent,
the genius which coloured that matchless altar-piece
found its inspiration within the walls of Bruges.</p>

<p>The history of Bruges for many long years,
especially under the rule of the House of Burgundy,
was, in the midst of war, turmoil, and
rebellion, the history of continuous progress. But
all this prosperity depended on the sea. So long
as the Zwijn remained open, neither war nor
faction, not even the last great rising against the
Archduke Maximilian, which drove away the
foreign merchants, most of whom went to Antwerp,
and so impoverished the town that no less
than 5,000 houses were standing empty in the
year 1405,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
could have entirely ruined Bruges. These disasters
might have been retrieved if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
channel of communication with Damme and Sluis
had not been lost; but for a long time the condition
of this important waterway had been the
cause of grave anxiety to the people of Bruges.
The heavy volume of water which poured with
every ebbing tide down the Scheldt between
Flushing and Breskens swept past the island of
Walcheren, and spread out into the North Sea and
down the English Channel, leaving the mud it
carried with it on the sands round the mouth of
the Zwijn, which itself did not discharge a current
strong enough to prevent the slow but sure formation
of a bank across its entrance. Charters, moreover,
had been granted to various persons, under
which they drained the adjoining lands, and gradually
reclaimed large portions from the sea. The
channel, at no time very deep, became shallower,
narrower, and more difficult of access, until at last,
during the second half of the fifteenth century,
the passage between Sluis and Damme was navigable
only by small ships. Soon the harbour at
Damme was nearly choked up with sand. Many
schemes were tried in the hope of preserving the
Zwijn, but the sea-trade of Bruges dwindled away
to a mere nothing, and finally disappeared before
the middle of the sixteenth century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
And so Bruges fell from greatness. There are
still some traces of the ancient bed of the Zwijn
amongst the fields near Coolkerke, a village a short
distance to the north of Bruges&mdash;a broad ditch with
broken banks, and large pools of slimy water lying
desolate and forlorn in a wilderness of tangled
bushes. These are now the only remains of the
highway by which the 'deep-laden argosies' used
to enter in the days of old.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>'BRUGES LA MORTE'</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">hey</span> call it 'Bruges la Morte,' and at every turn
there is something to remind us of the deadly
blight which fell upon the city when its trade was
lost. The faded colours, the timeworn brickwork,
the indescribable look of decay which, even on the
brightest morning, throws a shade of melancholy
over the whole place, lead one to think of some
aged dame, who has 'come down in the world,'
wearing out the finery of better days. It is all
very sad and pathetic, but strangely beautiful, and
the painter never lived who could put on canvas
the mellow tints with which Time has clothed these
old walls, and thus veiled with tender hand the
havoc it has made. To stand on the bridge which
crosses the canal at the corner of the Quai des
Marbriers and the Quai Vert, where the pinnacles
of the Palais du Franc and the roof of the Hôtel
de Ville, with the Belfry just showing above them,
and dull red walls rising from the water, make up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a unique picture of still-life, is to read a sermon in
stones, an impressive lesson in history.</p>

<p>The loss of trade brought Bruges face to face
with the 'question of the unemployed' in a very
aggravated form. How to provide for the poor
became a most serious problem, and so many of
the people were reduced to living on charity that
almshouses sprang up all over the town. God's
Houses ('Godshuisen') they called them, and call
them still. They are to be found in all directions&mdash;quaint
little places, planted down here and there,
each with a small chapel of its own, with moss-grown
roofs and dingy walls, and doors that open
on to the uneven cobbles. Every stone of them
spells pauperism. The Church does much towards
maintaining these shelters for the poor&mdash;perhaps
too much, if it is true that there are 10,000 paupers
in Bruges out of a population of about 55,000.
There is a great deal of begging in the streets, and
a sad lack of sturdy self-respect amongst the lower
class, which many think is caused by the system
of doles, for which the Church is chiefly responsible.
Bruges might not have been so picturesque to-day
if her commerce had survived; but the beauty of a
town is dearly purchased at the cost of such degradation
and loss of personal independence.</p>

<p>It was not only the working class which
suffered. Many rich families sank into poverty,
and their homes, some of which were more like
palaces than private houses, had to be dismantled.
The fate of one of these lordly mansions is connected
with an episode which carries us back into the
social life of Bruges in the middle of the seventeenth
century. On the right side of the Rue
Haute, as one goes from the Place du Bourg, there
is a high block containing two large houses, Nos. 6
and 8, of that street. It is now a big, plain building
without a trace of architectural distinction; but in
the seventeenth century it was a single mansion,
built about the year 1320, and was one of the many
houses with towers which gave the Bruges of that
time almost the appearance of an Oriental city. It
was called the House of the Seven Towers, from
the seven pinnacles which surmounted it; and at
the back there was a large garden, which extended
to the canal and Quai des Marbriers.</p>

<p>In April, 1656, the 'tall man above two yards
high, with dark brown hair, scarcely to be distinguished
from black,' for whom the Roundheads had
searched all England after the Battle of Worcester,
found his way to Bruges, with his brother Henry,
Duke of Gloucester, and the train of Royalists who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
formed their Court. For nearly three years after
Worcester, Charles II. had lived in France; but in
July, 1654, the alliance between Cromwell and
Mazarin drove him to Germany, where he remained
till Don John of Austria became Governor
of the Spanish Netherlands. Thereupon the prospect
of recovering the English throne by the assistance
of Spain led him to remove his Court, which
had been established for some time at Cologne, to
Flanders. He arrived at Bruges on April 22, 1656.
His brother James, Duke of York, and afterwards
King of England, held a commission in the French
army, and Mazarin offered him a command in
Italy. Charles, however, requested him to leave
the French army, and enter the service of Spain.
At first James refused; but by the mediation of
their sister, the Princess of Orange, he was persuaded
to do as his brother wished, and join the
Court at Bruges. The Irish Viscount Tarah received
Charles, when he first arrived, in his house
in the Rue du Vieux Bourg, and there gave him,
we read in local history, 'une brillante hospitalité.'
But in the beginning of June the Court took up
its quarters in the House of the Seven Towers.</p>

<p>During his sojourn in Flanders, Charles was carefully
watched by the secret service officers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Commonwealth Government, who sent home reports
of all he did. These reports, many of which
are in the Thurloe State Papers and other collections,
contain some curious details about the exiled
Court.</p>

<p>There never was a more interesting 'English
colony' at Bruges than at that time. Hyde, who
received the Great Seal at Bruges, was there with
Ormonde and the Earls of Bristol, Norwich, and
Rochester. Sir Edward Nicholas was Secretary of
State; and we read of Colonel Sydenham, Sir
Robert Murray, and 'Mr. Cairless', who sat on the
tree with Charles Stewart after Worcester fight.
Another of the exiles at Bruges was Sir James
Turner, the soldier of fortune, who served under
Gustavus Adolphus, persecuted the Covenanters
in Scotland, and is usually supposed to have been
the original of Dugald Dalgetty in Sir Walter
Scott's <i>Legend of Montrose</i>. A list of the royal
household is still preserved at Bruges. It was prepared
in order that the town council might fix the
daily allowance of wine and beer which was to be
given to the Court, and contains the names of
about sixty persons, with a note of the supply
granted to each family.</p>

<p>A 'Letter of Intelligence' (the report of a spy),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
dated from Bruges on September 29, 1656, mentions
that Lilly, the astrologer of London, had
written to say that the King would be restored to
the throne next year, and that all the English at
Bruges were delighted. But in the meantime they
were very hard up for ready money. Ever since
leaving England Charles and his followers had
suffered from the most direful impecuniosity. We
find Hyde declaring that he has 'neither shoes nor
shirt.' The King himself was constantly running
into debt for his meals, and his friends spent many
a hungry day at Bruges. If by good luck they
chanced to be in funds, one meal a day sufficed for
a party of half a dozen courtiers. If it was cold
they could not afford to purchase firewood. The
Earl of Norwich writes, saying that he has to move
about so as to get lodgings on credit, and avoid
people to whom he owes money. Colonel Borthwick,
who claims to have served the King most
faithfully, complains that he is in prison at Bruges
on suspicion of disloyalty, has not changed his
clothes for three years, and is compelled by lack of
cash to go without a fire in winter. Sir James
Hamilton, a gentleman-in-waiting, gets drunk one
day, and threatens to kill the Lord Chancellor.
He is starving, and declares it is Hyde's fault that the King gives him no money.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></div>

<p> He will put on a clean shirt to be hanged in, and not run away,
being without so much as a penny. Then we have
the petition of a poor fencing-master. 'Heaven,'
he writes piteously, 'hears the groans of the lowest
creatures, and therefore I trust that you, being a
terrestrial deity, will not disdain my supplication.'
He had come from Cologne to Bruges to teach the
royal household, and wanted his wages, for he and
his family were starving.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_068fp.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="409" height="600" /></div>

<p>Don John of Austria visited Charles at Bruges,
and an allowance from the King of Spain was
promised, so that men might be levied for the
operations against Cromwell; but the payments
were few and irregular. 'The English Court,' says
a letter of February, 1657, 'remains still at Bridges
[Bruges], never in greater want, nor greater expectations
of money, without which all their levies are
like to be at a stand; for Englishmen cannot live
on bread alone.'</p>

<p>A 'Letter of Intelligence' sent from Sluis says
that Charles is 'much loocked upon, but littell
respeckted.' And this is not wonderful if the
reports sent home by the Commonwealth agents
are to be trusted. One of the spies who haunted
the neighbourhood of Bruges was a Mr. Butler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
who writes in the winter of 1656-1657: 'This last
week one of the richest churches in Bruges was
plundered in the night. The people of Bruges are
fully persuaded that Charles Stewart's followers
have done it. They spare no pains to find out the
guilty, and if it happen to light upon any of Charles
Stewart's train, it will mightily incense that people
against them.... There is now a company of
French comedians at Bruges, who are very punctually
attended by Charles Stewart and his Court,
and all the ladies there. Their most solemn day of
acting is the Lord's Day. I think I may truly say
that greater abominations were never practised
among people than at this day at Charles Stewart's
Court. Fornication, drunkenness, and adultery are
esteemed no sins amongst them; so I persuade
myself God will never prosper any of their attempts.'<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
In another letter we read that once,
after a hunting expedition, Charles and a gentleman
of the bedchamber were the only two who came
back sober. Sir James Turner was mad when
drunk, 'and that was pretty often,' says Bishop
Burnet.</p>

<p>But, of course, it was the business of the spies to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
blacken the character of Charles; and there can be
little doubt that, in spite of his poverty and loose
morals, he was well liked by the citizens of Bruges,
who, notwithstanding a great deal of outward
decorum, have at no time been very strait-laced.
'Charles,' we learn from a local history, 'sut se
rendre populaire en prenant part aux amusements
de la population et en se pliant, sans effort comme
sans affectation, aux usages du pays.' During his
whole period of exile he contrived to amuse himself.
Affairs of gallantry, dancing, tennis, billiards, and
other frivolous pursuits, occupied as much of his
attention as the grave affairs of State over which
Hyde and Ormonde spent so many anxious hours.
When on a visit to Brussels in the spring of 1657,
he employed, we are told, most of his time with
Don John dancing, or at 'long paume, a Spanish
play with balls filled with wire.' And, again: 'He
passes his time with shooting at Bruges, and such
other obscure pastimes.'</p>

<p>This 'shooting' was the favourite Flemish sport
of shooting with bow and arrows at an artificial
bird fixed on a high pole, the prize being, on great
occasions, a golden bird, which was hung by a chain
of gold round the winner's neck. In the records
of the Guilds of St. George and St. Sebastian at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Bruges there are notices relating to Charles. The
former was a society of cross-bowmen, the latter of
archers. On June 11, 1656, Charles and the Duke
of Gloucester were at the festival of the Society of
St. George. Charles was the first to try his skill,
and managed to hit the mark. After the Duke
and many others had shot, Peter Pruyssenaere, a
wine merchant in the Rue du Vieux Bourg, brought
down the bird, and Charles hung the golden 'Bird
of Honour' round his neck. On June 25 Charles
visited the Society of St. Sebastian, when Michael
Noé, a gardener, was the winner. The King and
Gloucester both became members of the St.
Sebastian, which is still a flourishing society.
Going along the Rue des Carmes, the traveller
passes the English convent on the left, and on the
right, at the end of the street, comes to the Guildhouse
of St. Sebastian, with its slender tower and
quiet garden, one of the pleasantest spots in Bruges.
There the names of Charles and his brother are
to be seen inscribed in a small volume bound in
red morocco, the 'Bird of Honour' with its chain
of gold, a silver arrow presented by the Duke of
Gloucester, and some other interesting relics. On
September 15, 1843, Queen Victoria, Prince Albert,
King Leopold I., and the Queen of the Belgians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
went to the Rue des Carmes and signed their
names as members of this society, which now possesses
two silver cups, presented by the Queen of
England in 1845 and 1893. The Duke of York
seems to have been successful as an archer, for in
the Hôtel de Ville at Bruges there is a picture by
John van Meuninxhove, in which Charles is seen
hanging the 'Bird of Honour' round his brother's
neck.</p>

<p>In April, 1657, the English Government was
informed that the Court of Charles was preparing
to leave Bruges. 'Yesterday' (April 7) 'some of
his servants went before to Brussels to make ready
lodgings for Charles Stewart, the Duke of York,
and the Duke of Gloucester. All that have or
can compass so much money go along with Charles
Stewart on Monday morning. I do admire how
people live here for want of money. Our number
is not increased since my last. The most of them
are begging again for want of money; and when
any straggling persons come, we have not so much
money as will take a single man to the quarters;
yet we promise ourselves great matters.' They
were hampered in all their movements by this want
of hard cash, for Charles was in debt at Bruges,
and could not remove his goods until he paid his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
creditors. It was sadly humiliating. 'The King,'
we read, 'will hardly live at Bruges any more, but
he cannot remove his family and goods till we get
money.' The dilemma seems to have been settled
by Charles, his brothers, and most of the Court
going off to Brussels, leaving their possessions
behind them. The final move did not take place
till February, 1658, and Clarendon says that Charles
never lived at Bruges after that date. He may,
however, have returned on a short visit, for Jesse,
in his <i>Memoirs of the Court of England under
the Stuarts</i>, states that the King was playing tennis
at Bruges when Sir Stephen Fox came to him with
the great news, 'The devil is dead!' This would
be in September, 1658, Cromwell having died on
the third of that month. After the Restoration
Charles sent to the citizens of Bruges a letter of
thanks for the way in which they had received him.
Nor did he forget, amidst the pleasures of the
Court at Whitehall, the simple pastimes of the
honest burghers, but presented to the archers of
the Society of St. Sebastian the sum of 3,600 florins,
which were expended on their hall of meeting.</p>

<p>More than a hundred years later, when the
Stuart dynasty was a thing of the past and
George III. was seated on the throne of England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the Rue Haute saw the arrival of some travellers who
were very different from the roystering Cavaliers and
frail beauties who had made it gay in the days of
the Merry Monarch. The English Jesuits of
St. Omer, when expelled from their college, came
to Bruges in August, 1762, and took up their abode
in the House of the Seven Towers, where they
found 'nothing but naked walls and empty chambers.'
A miserable place it must have been. 'In
one room a rough table of planks had been set up,
and the famished travellers were rejoiced at the
sight of three roast legs of mutton set on the
primitive table. Knives, forks, and plates there
were none. A Flemish servant divided the food
with his pocket-knife. A farthing candle gave a
Rembrandt-like effect to the scene. The boys
slept that night on mattresses laid on the floor of
one of the big empty rooms of the house. The
first days at Bruges were cheerless enough.'<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The religious houses, however, came to the rescue.
Flemish monks and the nuns of the English convent
helped the pilgrims, and the Jesuits soon
established themselves at Bruges, where they remained
in peace for a few years, till the Austrian
Government drove them out. The same fate overtook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the inmates of many monasteries and convents
at Bruges in the reign of Joseph II., whose
reforming zeal led to that revolt of the Austrian
Netherlands which was the prelude to the invasion
of Flanders by the army of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>After the conquest of Belgium by the French it
looked as if all the churches in Bruges were doomed.
The Chapel of St. Basil was laid in ruins. The
Church of St. Donatian, which had stood since the
days of Baldwin Bras-de-Fer, was pulled down and
disappeared entirely. Notre Dame, St. Sauveur,
and other places of worship, narrowly escaped destruction;
and it was not till the middle of the
nineteenth century that the town recovered, in
some measure, from these disasters.</p>

<p>Bruges has doubtless shared in the general prosperity
which has spread over the country since
Belgium became an independent kingdom after the
revolution of 1830, but its progress has been slow.
It has never lost its old-world associations; and the
names of the streets and squares, and the traditions
connected with numberless houses which a stranger
might pass without notice, are all so many links with
the past. There is the Rue Espagnole, for example,
where a vegetable market is held every Wednesday.
This was the quarter where the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
merchants lived and did their business. There used
to be a tall, dark, and, in fact, very dirty-looking
old house in this street known by the Spanish name
of the 'Casa Negra.' It was pulled down a few
years ago; but lower down, at the foot of the street,
the great cellars in which the Spaniards stored their
goods remain; and on the Quai Espagnol was the
Spanish Consulate, now a large dwelling-house. A
few steps from the Quai Espagnol is the Place des
Orientaux (Oosterlingen Plaats), where a minaret
of tawny brick rises above the gables of what was
once the Consulate of Smyrna, and on the north
side of which, in the brave days of old, stood the
splendid Maison des Orientaux, the headquarters of
the Hanseatic League in Bruges, the finest house
in Flanders, with turrets and soaring spire, and
marvellous façade, and rooms inside all ablaze with
gilding. The glory has departed; two modern
dwelling-houses have taken the place of this
commercial palace; but it must surely be a very
dull imagination on which the sight of this spot,
now so tranquil and commonplace, but once the
centre of such important transactions, makes no
impression. From the Place des Orientaux it is
only a few minutes' stroll to the Rue Cour de
Gand and the dark brown wooden front of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
small house, now a lace shop, which tradition says
was one of Memlinc's homes in Bruges, where we can
fancy him, laboriously and with loving care, putting
the last minute touches to some immortal painting.</p>

<p>Then there is the Rue Anglaise, off the Quai
Spinola, where the English Merchant Adventurers
met to discuss their affairs in houses with such
names as 'Old England' or 'The Tower of
London.' The head of the colony, 'Governor of
the English Nation beyond the Seas' they called
him, was a very busy man 400 years ago.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Scottish merchants were settled in the same district,
close to the Church of Ste. Walburge. They called
their house 'Scotland,' and doubtless made as good
bargains as the 'auld enemy' in the next street.
There is a building called the Parijssche Halle, or
Halle de Paris, hidden away among the houses to
the west of the Market-Place, with a cafe and a
theatre where Flemish plays are acted now, which
was formerly the Consulate of France; and subscription
balls and amateur theatricals are given by
the English residents of to-day in the fourteenth-century
house of the Genoese merchants in the
Rue Flamande. The list of streets and houses with old-time associations like these might be
extended indefinitely, for in Bruges the past is
ever present.</p>

<h3>BRUGES</h3>
<p class="center">Vegetable Market.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></div>

<p>Even the flat-fronted, plain houses with which
poverty or the bad taste of the last century replaced
many of the older buildings do not spoil the picturesque
appearance of the town as a whole, because
it is no larger now than it was 600 years ago, and
these modern structures are quite lost amongst
their venerable neighbours. Thus Bruges retains
its mediæval character. In the midst, however, of
all this wealth of architectural beauty and historical
interest, the atmosphere of common everyday life
seems to be so very dull and depressing that people
living there are apt to be driven, by sheer boredom,
into spending their lives in a round of small excitements
and incessant, wearisome gossip, and into
taking far more interest in the paltry squabbles of
their neighbours over some storm in a teacup than
in the more important topics which invigorate
the minds of men and women in healthier and
broader societies. Long before Rodenbach's romance
was written this peculiarity of Bruges was proverbial
throughout Belgium.</p>

<p>But it is possible that a change is at hand, and
that Bruges may once again become, not the Venice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of the North&mdash;the time for that is past&mdash;but an important
town, for the spirit of commercial enterprise
which has done so much for other parts of Belgium
during the last seventy-five years is now invading
even this quiet place, whose citizens have begun to
dream of recovering some portion of their former
prosperity. In 1895 the Belgian Parliament passed
a law providing for the construction, between Blankenberghe
and Heyst, of a harbour connected with
Bruges by a canal of large dimensions, and of an
inner port at the town. The works at See-Brugge,
as the outer port is called, are nearly completed,
and will allow vessels drawing 26½ feet of water to
float at any state of the tide. The jetty describes
a large curve, and the bend is such that its extremity
is parallel to the coast, and 930 yards distant from
the low-water mark. The sheltered roadstead is
about 272 acres in extent, and communication is
made with the canal by a lock 66 feet wide and
282 yards in length. From this point the canal,
which has a depth of 26½ feet and is fed by seawater,
runs in a straight line to Bruges, and ends at
the inner port, which is within a few hundred yards
of where the Roya used to meet the Zwijn. It is
capable of affording a minimum capacity of 1,000,000
tons per annum, and the whole equipment has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
fitted up necessary for dealing with this amount of
traffic.</p>

<p>The first ship, an English steamer, entered the
new port at Bruges on the morning of May 29 in
the present year (1905). The carillon rung from
the Belfry, guns were fired, and a ceremony in
honour of the event took place in the Hôtel de
Ville. It now remains to be seen whether any part
of the trade which was lost 400 years ago can be
recovered by the skill of modern engineers and the
resources of modern capital.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>THE PLAIN OF WEST FLANDERS&mdash;YPRES</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">o</span> the west of Bruges the wide plain of Flanders
extends to the French frontier. Church spires and
windmills are the most prominent objects in the
landscape; but though the flatness of the scenery
is monotonous, there is something pleasing to the
eye in the endless succession of well-cultivated
fields, interrupted at intervals by patches of rough
bushland, canals, or slow-moving streams winding
between rows of pollards, country houses embowered
in woods and pleasure-grounds, cottages
with fruitful gardens, orchards, small villages,
and compact little towns, in most of which the
diligent antiquary will find something of interest&mdash;a
modest belfry, perhaps, with a romance of
its own; a parish church, whose foundations were
laid long ago in ground dedicated, in the distant
past, to the worship of Thor or Woden; or the
remains, it may be, of a mediæval castle, from
which some worthy knight, whose name is for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>gotten
except in local traditions, rode away to the
Crusades.</p>

<p>This part of West Flanders, which lies wedged
in between the coast, with its populous bathing
stations, and the better-known district immediately
to the south of it, where Ghent, Tournai, Courtrai,
and other important centres draw many travellers
every year, is seldom visited by strangers, who are
almost as much stared at in some of the villages
as they would be in the streets of Pekin. It is,
however, very accessible. The roads are certainly
far from good, and anything in the shape of a
walking tour is out of the question, for the
strongest pedestrian would have all his pleasure
spoilt by the hard-going of the long, straight
causeway. The ideal way to see the Netherlands
and study the life of the people is to travel on the
canals; but these are not so numerous here as in
other parts of the country, and, besides, it is not
very easy to arrange for a passage on the barges.
But, in addition to the main lines of the State
Railway, there are the 'Chemins-de-fer Vicinaux,'
or light district railways, which run through all parts
of Belgium. The fares on these are very low, and
there are so many stoppages that the traveller can
see a great many places in the course of a single day.
There are cycle tracks, too, alongside most
of the roads, the cost of keeping them in order
being paid out of the yearly tax paid by the
owners of bicycles.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h3>THE FLEMISH PLAIN</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_084fp.jpg" alt="THE FLEMISH PLAIN" width="600" height="472" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></div>

<p>This is the most purely Flemish part of Flanders.
One very seldom notices that Spanish type of face
which is so common elsewhere&mdash;at Antwerp, for
instance. Here the race is almost unmixed, and
the peasants speak nothing but Flemish to each
other. Many of them do not understand a word
of French, though in Belgium French is, as everyone
knows, the language of public life and of literature.
The newspapers published in Flemish are
small, and do not contain much beyond local news.
The result is that the country people in West
Flanders know very little of what is going on in
the world beyond their own parishes. The standard
of education is low, being to a great extent in the
hands of the clergy, who have hitherto succeeded
in defeating all proposals for making it universal
and compulsory.</p>

<p>But, steeped as most of them are in ignorance
and superstition, the agricultural labourers of West
Flanders are, to all appearance, quite contented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
with their lot. Living is cheap, and their wants
are few. Coffee, black bread, potatoes, and salted
pork, are the chief articles of diet, and in some
households even the pork is a treat for special
occasions. They seldom taste butter, using lard
instead; and the 'margarine' which is sold in the
towns does not find its way into the cottages of
the outlying country districts. Sugar has for many
years been much dearer than in England, and the
price is steadily rising, but with this exception the
food of the people is cheap. Tea enters Belgium
duty free, but the peasants never use it. Many
villagers smoke coarse tobacco grown in their own
gardens, and a 10-centimes cigar is the height of
luxury. Tobacco being a State monopoly in
France, the high price in that country makes
smuggling common, and there is a good deal of
contraband trading carried on in a quiet way on
the frontiers of West Flanders. The average
wage paid for field labour is from 1 franc 50 centimes
to 2 francs a day for married men&mdash;that
is to say, from about 1s. 3d. to 1s. 8d. of English
money. Bachelors generally receive 1 franc (10d.)
a day and their food. The working hours are long,
often from five in the morning till eight in the
evening in summer, and in winter from sunrise till
sunset, with one break at twelve o'clock for dinner,
consisting of bread with pork and black coffee, and
another about four in the afternoon, when what
remains of the mid-day meal is consumed.</p>

<h3>A FLEMISH COUNTRY GIRL</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_086fp.jpg" alt="A FLEMISH COUNTRY GIRL" width="418" height="600" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></div>

<p>The Flemish farmhouse is generally a substantial
building, with two large living-rooms, in which
valuable old pieces of furniture are still occasionally
to be found, though the curiosity dealers have,
during the last quarter of a century, carried most
of them away, polished them up, and sold them
at a high profit. Carved chests, bearing the arms
of ancient families, have been discovered lying full
of rubbish in barns or stables, and handsome
cabinets, with fine mouldings and brass fittings,
have frequently been picked up for a few francs.
The heavy beams of the ceilings, black with age,
the long Flemish stoves, and the quaint window-seats
deeply sunk in the thick walls, still remain,
and make the interiors of many of these houses
very picturesque; but the 'finds' of old furniture,
curious brass or pewter dishes, and even stray
bits of valuable tapestry, which used to rouse
the cupidity of strangers, are now very rare.
Almost all the brass work which is so eagerly
bought by credulous tourists at Bruges in summer
is bran-new stuff cleverly manufactured for sale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>&mdash;and sold it is at five or six times its real market
value! There are no bargains to be picked up on
the Dyver or in the shops of Bruges.</p>

<h3>DUINHOEK<br /><small>Interior of a Farmhouse.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_088fp.jpg" alt="DUINHOEK&mdash;Interior of a Farmhouse." width="600" height="487" /></div>

<p>The country life is simple. A good deal of hard
drinking goes on in most villages. More beer,
probably, is consumed in Belgium per head of the
population than in any other European country,
Germany not excepted, and the system of swallowing
'little glasses' of fiery spirit on the top of beer
brings forth its natural fruits. The drunken ways
of the people are encouraged by the excessive
number of public-houses. Practically anyone who
can pay the Government fee and obtain a barrel of
beer and a few tumblers may open a drinking-shop.
It is not uncommon in a small country village
with about 200 inhabitants to see the words
'Herberg' or 'Estaminet' over the doors of a
dozen houses, in which beer is sold at a penny
(or less) for a large glass, and where various throat-burning
liquors of the <i>petit verre</i> species can be
had at the same price; and the result is that very
often a great portion of the scanty wage paid on
Saturday evening is melted into beer or gin on
Sunday and Monday. </p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></div>

<p>As a rule, the Flemish labourer, being a merry,
light-hearted soul, is merely noisy and jovial in a
brutal sort of way in his cups; but let a quarrel
arise, out come the knives, and before the rural policeman saunters
along there are nasty rows, ending in wounds and
sometimes in murder. When the lots are drawn
for military service, and crowds of country lads
with their friends flock into the towns, the public-houses
do good business. Those who have drawn
lucky numbers, and so escaped the conscription,
get drunk out of joy; while those who find they
must serve in the army drown their sorrow, or
celebrate the occasion if they are of a martial turn,
by reeling about the streets arm in arm with their
companions, shouting and singing. Whole families,
old and young alike, often join in these performances,
and they must be very drunk and very disorderly
before the police think of making even the
mildest remonstrance.</p>

<p>The gay character of the Flemings is best seen
at the 'kermesse,' or fair, which is held in almost
every village during summer. At Bruges, Ypres,
and Furnes, and still more in such large cities as
Brussels or Antwerp, the kermesse has ceased to
be typical of the country, and is supplanted by fairs
such as may be seen in England or in almost any
other country. 'Merry-go-rounds' driven by
steam, elaborate circuses, menageries, waxwork
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
exhibitions, movable theatres, and modern 'shows'
of every kind travel about, and settle for a few
days, perhaps even for a few weeks, in various
towns. The countryfolk of the surrounding district
are delighted, and the showmen reap a goodly
harvest of francs and centimes; but these fairs are
tiresome and commonplace, much less amusing and
lively than, for example, St. Giles's Fair at Oxford,
though very nearly as noisy. But the kermesse
proper, which still survives in some places, shows
the Flemings amusing themselves in something
more like the old fashion than anything which can
be seen in the Market-Place of Bruges or on the
boulevards of Brussels or Antwerp. Indeed, some
of the village scenes, when the young people are
dancing or shooting with bows and arrows at the
mark, while the elders sit, with their mugs of beer
and long pipes, watching and gossiping, are very
like what took place in the times of the old painters
who were so fond of producing pictures of the
kermesses. The dress of the people, of course,
is different, but the spirit of the scene, with its
homely festivities, is wonderfully little changed.</p>

<p>About twenty miles from the French frontier is
the town of Ypres, once the capital of Flanders, and
which in the time of Louis of Nevers was one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the three 'bonnes villes,' Bruges and Ghent being
the others, which appointed deputies to defend the
rights and privileges of the whole Flemish people.</p>

<p>As Bruges grew out of the rude fortress on the
banks of the Roya, so Ypres developed from a
stronghold built, probably about the year 900, on a
small island in the river Yperlee. It was triangular
in shape, with a tower at each corner, and was at
first known by the inhabitants of the surrounding
plain as the 'Castle of the Three Towers.' In
course of time houses began to appear on the banks
of the river near the island. A rampart of earth
with a ditch defended these, and as the place grew,
the outworks became more extensive. Owing to
its strategic position, near France and in a part of
Flanders which was constantly the scene of war, it
was of great importance; and probably no other
Flemish town has seen its defences so frequently
altered and enlarged as Ypres has between the
primitive days when the Crusading Thierry d'Alsace
planted hedges of live thorns to strengthen the
towers, and the reign of Louis XIV., when a vast
and elaborate system of fortifications was constructed
on scientific principles, under the direction
of Vauban.</p>

<p>The citizens of Ypres took a prominent part in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
most of the great events which distinguished the
heroic period of Flemish history. In July, 1302,
a contingent of 1,200 chosen men, '500 of them
clothed in scarlet and the rest in black,' were set
to watch the town and castle of Courtrai during
the Battle of the Golden Spurs, and in the following
year the victory was celebrated by the institution
of the Confraternity of the Archers of St. Sebastian,
which still exists at Ypres, the last survivor of the
armed societies which flourished there during the
Middle Ages. Seven hundred burghers of Ypres
marched to Sluis, embarked in the Flemish boats
which harassed the French fleet during the naval
fight of June, 1340, and at the close of the campaign
formed themselves into the Confraternity of
St. Michael, which lasted till the French invasion
of 1794. Forty years later we find no fewer than
5,000 of the men of Ypres, who had now changed
their politics, on the French side at the Battle of
Roosebeke, fighting in the thick mist upon the
plain between Ypres and Roulers on that fatal
day which saw the death of Philip van Artevelde
and the triumph of the Leliarts.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></div>

<p>Next year, so unceasingly did the tide of war
flow over the plain of Flanders, an English army,
commanded by Henry Spencer, Bishop of Norwich,
landed at Calais under the pretext of supporting
the partisans of Pope Urban VI., who then occupied
the Holy See, against the adherents of Pope
Clement VII., who had established himself at
Avignon. The burghers of Ghent flocked to the
English standard, and the allies laid siege to Ypres,
which was defended by the French and the Leliarts,
who followed Louis of Maele, Count of Flanders,
and maintained the cause of Clement.</p>

<p>At that time the gateways were the only part
of the fortifications made of stone. The ramparts
were of earth, planted on the exterior slope with
a thick mass of thorn-bushes, interlaced and
strengthened by posts. Outside there were more
defences of wooden stockades, and beyond them
two ditches, divided by a dyke, on which was a
palisade of pointed stakes. The town, thus fortified,
was defended by about 10,000 men, and on June 8,
1383, the siege was begun by a force consisting of
17,000 English and 20,000 Flemings of the national
party, most of whom came from Bruges and
Ghent.</p>

<p>The English had been told that the town would
not offer a strong resistance, and on the first day of
the siege 1,000 of them tried to carry it at once
by assault. They were repulsed; and after that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
assaults by the besiegers and sorties by the garrison
continued day after day, the loss of life on both
sides being very great. At last the besiegers, finding
that they could not, in the face of the shower
of arrows, javelins, and stones which met them,
break through the palisades and the sharp thorn
fences (those predecessors of the barbed-wire entanglements
of to-day), force the gates, or carry the ramparts, built
three wooden towers mounted on wheels, and pushed
them full of soldiers up to the gates. But the garrison
made a sortie, seized the towers, destroyed them,
and killed or captured the soldiers who manned them.</p>

<p>Spencer on several occasions demanded the surrender
of the town, but all his proposals were
rejected. The English pressed closer and closer,
but were repulsed with heavy losses whenever they
delivered an assault. The hopes of the garrison
rose high on August 7, the sixty-first day of the
siege, when news arrived that a French army,
100,000 strong, accompanied by the forces of the
Count of Flanders, was marching to the relief of
Ypres. Early next morning the English made a
fresh attempt to force their way into the town, but
they were once more driven back. A little later in
the day they twice advanced with the utmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
bravery. Again they were beaten back. So were
the burghers of Ghent, whom the English reproached
for having deceived them by saying that
Ypres would fall in three days, and whose answer
to this accusation was a furious attack on one of
the gates, in which many of them fell. In the
afternoon the English again advanced, and succeeded
in forcing their way through part of the
formidable thorn hedge; but it was of no avail, and
once more they had to retire, leaving heaps of dead
behind them. After a rest of some hours, another
attack was made on seven different parts of the
town at the same time. This assault was the most
furious and bloody of the siege, but it was the last.
Spencer saw that, in spite of the splendid courage
of his soldiers and of the Flemish burghers, it
would be impossible to take the town before the
French army arrived, and during the night the
English, with their allies from Ghent and Bruges,
retired from before Ypres. The failure of this
campaign left Flanders at the mercy of France;
but the death of Count Louis of Maele, which took
place in January, 1384, brought in the House of
Burgundy, under whose rule the Flemings enjoyed
a long period of prosperity and almost complete
independence.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></div>

<p>It was believed in Ypres that the town had been
saved by the intercession of the Virgin Mary, its
patron saint. In the Cathedral Church of St.
Martin the citizens set up an image of Notre
Dame-de-Thuine, that is, Our Lady of the Enclosures,
an allusion to the strong barrier of thorns
which had kept the enemy at bay; and a kermesse,
appointed to be held on the first Sunday of
August every year in commemoration of the siege,
received the name of the 'Thuindag,' or Day of the
Enclosures.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The people of Ypres, though they
fought on the French side, had good reason to be
proud of the way in which they defended their
homes; but the consequences of the siege were
disastrous, for the commerce of the town never
recovered the loss of the large working-class population
which left it at that time.</p>

<h3>A FARMSTEADING</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_096fp.jpg" alt="A FARMSTEADING" width="600" height="426" /></div>

<p>The religious troubles of the sixteenth century
left their mark on Ypres as well as on the rest of
Flanders. Everyone has read the glowing sentences
in which the historian of the Dutch Republic describes
the Cathedral of Antwerp, and tells how it
was wrecked by the reformers during the image-breaking
in the summer of 1566. What happened on the banks of the Scheldt </p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></div>

<p>appeals most to the imagination; but all over Flanders the statues and
the shrines, the pictures and the stores of ecclesiastical
wealth, with which piety, or superstition, or
penitence had enriched so many churches and
religious houses, became the objects of popular fury.
There had been field-preaching near Ypres as early
as 1562.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Other parts of West Flanders had been
visited by the apostles of the New Learning, and
on August 15, 1566, the reformers swept down
upon Ypres and sacked the churches.</p>

<p>In the awful tragedy which soon followed, when
Parma came upon the scene, that 'spectacle of
human energy, human suffering, and human
strength to suffer, such as has not often been
displayed upon the stage of the world's events',
the town had its share of the persecutions and
exactions which followed the march of the Spanish
soldiery; but for more than ten years a majority of
the burghers adhered to the cause of Philip. In
July, 1578, however, Ypres fell into the hands of the
Protestants, and became their headquarters in West
Flanders. Five years later Alexander of Parma
besieged it. The siege lasted until April of the
following year, when the Protestants, worn out by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
famine, capitulated, and the town was occupied by
the Spaniards, who 'resorted to instant measures
for cleansing a place which had been so long in the
hands of the infidels, and, as the first step towards
this purification, the bodies of many heretics
who had been buried for years were taken from
their graves and publicly hanged in their coffins.
All living adherents to the Reformed religion
were instantly expelled from the place.'<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> By this time the population was reduced to 5,000
souls, and the fortifications were a heap of ruins.</p>

<p>A grim memorial of those troublous times is still
preserved at Ypres. The Place du Musée is a
quiet corner of the town, where a Gothic house
with double gables contains a collection of old
paintings, medals, instruments of torture, and some
other curiosities. It was the Bishop of Ypres who,
at midnight on June 4, 1568, announced to Count
Egmont, in his prison at Brussels, that his hour
had come; and the cross-hilted sword, with its long
straight blade, which hangs on the wall of the
Museum is the sword with which the executioner
'severed his head from his shoulders at a single
blow' on the following morning. The same weapon, a few minutes
later, was used for the despatch of Egmont's friend, Count Horn.</p>

<p>Before the end of that dismal sixteenth century
Flanders regained some of the liberties for which
so much blood had been shed; but while the Protestant
Dutch Republic rose in the north, the
'Catholic' or 'Spanish' Netherlands in the south
remained in the possession of Spain until the marriage
of Philip's daughter Isabella to the Archduke
Albert, when these provinces were given as a
marriage portion to the bride. This was in 1599.
Though happier times followed under the moderate
rule of Albert and Isabella, war continued to be
the incessant scourge of Flanders, and during the
marching and countermarching of armies across
this battlefield of Europe, Ypres scarcely ever
knew what peace meant. Four times besieged and
four times taken by the French in the wars of
Louis XIV., the town had no rest; and for miles
all round it the fields were scarred by the new
system of attacking strong places which Vauban
had introduced into the art of war. Louis, accompanied
by Schomberg and Luxembourg, was himself
present at the siege of 1678; and Ypres, having
been ceded to France by the Treaty of Nimeguen
in that year, was afterwards strengthened by fortifications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
constructed from plans furnished by the
great French engineer.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1689 Vauban speaks of Ypres as a
place 'formerly great, populous, and busy, but
much reduced by the frequent sedition and revolts
of its inhabitants, and by the great wars which it
has endured.' And in this condition it has remained
ever since. Though the period which
followed the Treaty of Rastadt in 1714, when
Flanders passed into the possession of the Emperor
Charles VI., and became a part of the 'Austrian
Netherlands,' was a period of considerable improvement,
Ypres never recovered its position, not even
during the peaceful reign of the Empress Maria
Theresa. The revolution against Joseph II. disturbed
everything, and in June, 1794, the town
yielded, after a short siege, to the army of the
French Republic. The name of Flanders disappeared
from the map of Europe. The whole of
Belgium was divided, like France, with which it
was now incorporated, into <i>départements</i>, Ypres
being in the Department of the Lys. For twenty
years, during the wars of the Republic, the Consulate,
and the Empire, though the conscription was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
a constant drain upon the youth of Flanders, who
went away to leave their bones on foreign soil,
nothing happened to disturb the quiet of the town,
and the fortifications were falling into decay when
the return of Napoleon from Elba set Europe in a
blaze. During the Hundred Days guns and war
material were hurried over from England, the old
defences were restored, and new works constructed
by the English engineers; but the Battle of Waterloo
rendered these preparations unnecessary, and
the military history of Ypres came to an end when
the short-lived Kingdom of the Netherlands was
established by the Congress of Vienna, though it was
nominally a place of arms till 1852, when the fortifications
were destroyed. Nowadays everything is very
quiet and unwarlike. The bastions and lunettes, the
casemates and moats, which spread in every direction
round the town, have almost entirely disappeared,
and those parts of the fortifications which remain
have been turned into ornamental walks.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></div>

<p>But while so little remains of the works which
were constructed, at such a cost and with so much
labour, for the purposes of war, the arts of peace,
which once flourished at Ypres, have left a more
enduring monument. There is nothing in Bruges
or any other Flemish town which can compare for
massive grandeur with the pile of buildings at the
west end of the Grand' Place of Ypres. During
two centuries the merchants of Flanders, whose
towns were the chief centres of Western commerce
and civilization, grew to be the richest in Europe,
and a great portion of the wealth which industry
and public spirit had accumulated was spent in
erecting those noble civic and commercial buildings
which are still the glory of Flanders. The foundation-stone
of the Halle des Drapiers, or Cloth Hall,
of Ypres was laid by Baldwin of Constantinople,
then Count of Flanders, at the beginning of the
thirteenth century, but more than 100 years had
passed away before it was completed. Though the
name of the architect who began it is unknown, the
unity of design which characterizes the work makes
it probable that the original plans were adhered to
till the whole was finished. Nothing could be
simpler than the general idea; but the effect is very
fine. The ground-floor of the façade, about 150
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
yards long, is pierced by a number of rectangular
doors, over which are two rows of pointed windows,
each exactly above the other, and all of the same
style. In the upper row every second window is
filled up, and contains the statue of some historical
character. At each end there is a turret; and the
belfry, a square with towers at the corners, rises
from the centre of the building.</p>

<p>Various additions have been made from time to
time to the original Halle des Drapiers since it
was finished in the year 1304, and of these the
'Nieuwerck' is the most interesting. The east end
of the Halle was for a long time hidden by a number
of wooden erections, which, having been put up
for various purposes after the main building was
finished, were known as the 'Nieuwe wercken,' or
new works. They were pulled down in the beginning
of the seventeenth century, and replaced
by the stone edifice, in the style of the Spanish
Renaissance, which now goes by the name of the
Nieuwerck, with its ten shapely arches supported
by slender pillars, above whose sculptured capitals
rise tiers of narrow windows and the steeply-pitched
roof with gables of curiously carved stone. Ypres
had ceased to be a great commercial city long
before the Nieuwerck was built; but the Cloth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Hall was a busy place during the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries, when Ypres shared with
Bruges the responsibility of managing the Flemish
branch of the Hanseatic League.</p>

<p>The extensive system of monopolies which the
League maintained was, as a matter of course, the
cause of much jealousy and bad feeling. In
Flanders, Ghent, Bruges, and Ypres defended their
own privileges against other towns, and quarrelled
amongst themselves. The merchants of Ypres had
a monopoly which forbade all weaving for three
leagues round the town, under a penalty of fifty
livres and confiscation of the looms and linen
woven; but the weavers in the neighbouring communes
infringed this monopoly, and sold imitations
of Ypres linen cloth on all hands. There was constant
trouble between the people of Ypres and
their neighbours at Poperinghe. Sometimes the
weavers of Ypres, to enforce their exclusive privileges,
marched in arms against Poperinghe, and
sometimes the men of Poperinghe retaliated by
attacking their powerful rivals. Houses were
burnt, looms were broken up, and lives were lost
in these struggles, which were so frequent that for
a long time something like a chronic state of war
existed between the two places.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></div>

<p>Besides the troubles caused by the jealousy of
other towns, intestine disputes arising out of the
perpetual contest between labour and capital went
on from year to year within the walls of Ypres.
There, as in the other Flemish towns, a sharp line was
drawn between the working man, by whose hands
the linen was actually woven, and the merchants,
members of the Guilds, by whom it was sold. In
these towns, which maintained armies and made
treaties of peace, and whose friendship was sought
by princes and statesmen, the artisans, whose industry
contributed so much to the importance of
the community, resented any infringement of their
legal rights. By law the magistrates of Ypres
were elected annually, and because this had not
been done in 1361 the people rose in revolt against
the authorities. The mob invaded the Hôtel de
Ville, where the magistrates were assembled. The
Baillie, Jean Deprysenaere, trusting to his influence
as the local representative of the Count of Flanders,
left the council chamber, and tried to appease
the rioters. He was set upon and killed. Then the
crowd rushed into the council chamber, seized the
other magistrates, and locked them up in the belfry,
where they remained prisoners for some days. The
leaders of the revolt met, and resolved to kill their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
prisoners, and this sentence was executed on the
Burgomaster and two of the Sheriffs, who were
beheaded in front of the Halle in the presence
of their colleagues.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
It was by such stern deeds that the fierce democracy
of the Flemish communes preserved their rights.</p>

<p>Each town, however, stood for itself alone. The
idea of government by the populace on the market-place
was common to them all, but they were kept
apart by the exclusive spirit of commercial jealousy.
The thirst for material prosperity consumed them;
but they had no bond of union, and each was
ready to advance its own interests at the expense
of its rivals. Therefore, either in the face of
foreign invasion, or when the policy of some Count
led to revolt and civil war, it was seldom that the
people of Flanders were united. 'L'Union fait la
Force' is the motto of modern Belgium, but in
the Middle Ages there was no powerful central
authority round which the communes rallied.
Hence the spectacle of Ghent helping an English
army to storm the ramparts of Ypres, or of
the Guildsmen of Bruges girding on their swords
to strike a blow for Count Louis of Maele against
the White Hoods who marched from Ghent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Hence the permanent unrest of these Flemish
towns, the bickerings and the sheddings of blood,
the jealousy of trade pitted against trade or of
harbour against harbour, the insolence in the hour
of triumph and the abject submission in the hour
of defeat, and all the evils which discord brought
upon the country. No town suffered more than
Ypres from the distracted state of Flanders, which,
combined with the ravages of war and the religious
dissensions of the sixteenth century, reduced it
from the first rank amongst the cities of the
Netherlands to something very like the condition
of a quiet country town in an out-of-the-way
corner of England. That is what the Ypres of
to-day is like&mdash;a sleepy country town, with clean,
well-kept streets, dull and uninteresting save for
the stately Cloth Hall, which stands there a silent
memorial of the past.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>FURNES&mdash;THE PROCESSION OF PENITENTS</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> traveller wandering amongst the towns and
villages in this corner of West Flanders is apt to
feel that he is on a kind of sentimental journey
as he moves from place to place, and finds himself
everywhere surrounded by things which belong to
the past rather than to the present. The very guidebooks
are eloquent if we read between the lines.
This place 'was formerly of much greater importance.'
That 'was formerly celebrated for its
tapestries.' From this Hôtel de Ville 'the numerous
statuettes with which the building was once
embellished have all disappeared.' The tower of
that church has been left unfinished for the last
500 years. 'Fuimus' might be written on them
all. And so, some twenty miles north of Ypres,
on a plain which in the seventeenth century was so
studded with earthen redoubts and serrated by
long lines of field-works and ditches that the
whole countryside between Ypres and Dunkirk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
was virtually one vast entrenched camp, we come
to the town of Furnes, another of the places on
which time has laid its heavy hand.</p>

<p>The early history of Furnes is obscure, though
it is generally supposed to have grown up round a
fortress erected by Baldwin Bras-de-Fer to check
the inroads of the Normans. It suffered much,
like its neighbours, from wars and revolutions,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and is now one of the quietest of the Flemish
towns. The market-place is a small square,
quaintly picturesque, surrounded by clusters of
little brick houses with red and blue tiled roofs,
low-stepped gables, and deep mouldings round the
windows. Behind these dwelling-places the bold
flying buttresses of the Church of Ste. Walburge,
whose relics were brought to Furnes by Judith,
wife of Baldwin Bras-de-Fer, and the tower of
St. Nicholas, lift themselves on the north and east;
and close together in a corner to the west are the
dark gray Hôtel de Ville and Palais de Justice, in a room
of which the judges of the Inquisition used
to sit.</p>

<p>Though some features are common to nearly all
the Flemish towns&mdash;the market-place, the belfry,
the Hôtel de Ville, the old gateways, and the
churches, with their cherished paintings&mdash;yet each
of them has generally some association of its own.
In Bruges we think of how the merchants bought
and sold, how the gorgeous city rose, clothed itself
in all the colours of the rainbow, glittered for a
time, and sank in darkness. In the crowded streets
of modern Ghent, the busy capital of East Flanders,
we seem to catch a glimpse of bold Jacques van
Artevelde shouldering his way up to the Friday
Market, or of turbulent burghers gathering there to
set Pope, or Count of Flanders, or King of Spain
at defiance. Ypres and its flat meadows suggest
one of the innumerable paintings of the Flemish
wars, the 'battle-pieces' in which the Court artists
took such pride: the town walls with ditch and
glacis before them, and within them the narrow-fronted
houses, and the flag flying from steeple or
belfry; the clumsy cannon puffing out clouds of
smoke; the King of France capering on a fat horse
and holding up his baton in an attitude of command
in the foreground; and in the distance the tents of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the camp, where the travelling theatre was set up,
and the musicians fiddled, and an army of serving-men
waited on the rouged and powdered ladies who
had followed the army into Flanders.</p>

<p>Furnes, somehow, always recalls the Spanish
period. The Hôtel de Ville, a very beautiful
example of the Renaissance style, with its rare
hangings of Cordovan leather and its portraits of
the Archduke Albert and his bride, the Infanta
Isabella, is scarcely changed since it was built
soon after the death of Philip II. The Corps de
Garde Espagnol and the Pavilion des Officiers
Espagnols in the market-place, once the headquarters
of the whiskered bravos who wrought such
ills to Flanders, are now used by the Municipal
Council of the town as a museum and a public
library; but the stones of this little square were
often trodden by the persecutors, with their guards
and satellites, in the years when Peter Titelmann
the Inquisitor stalked through the fields of Flanders,
torturing and burning in the name of the Catholic
Church and by authority of the Holy Office. The
spacious room in which the tribunal of the Inquisition
sat is nowadays remarkable only for its
fine proportions and venerable appearance; but,
though it was not erected until after the Spanish fury had spent
its force, and at a time when wiser methods of government
had been introduced, it reminds us of the days when the maxims
of Torquemada were put in force amongst the Flemings by priests
more wicked and merciless than any who could be found in Spain. </p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></div>

<p>And in the
market-place the people must often have seen the
dreadful procession by means of which the Church
sought to strike terror into the souls of men.
Those public orgies of clerical intolerance were the
suitable consummation of the crimes which had
been previously committed in the private conclave
of the Inquisitors. The burning or strangling of
a heretic was not accompanied by so much pomp
and circumstance in small towns like Furnes as in
the great centres, where multitudes, led by the
highest in the land, were present to enjoy the
spectacle; but the Inquisition of the Netherlands,
under which Flanders groaned for so many years,
was, as Philip himself once boasted, 'much more
pitiless than that of Spain.'</p>

<p>The groans of the victims will never more be
heard in the torture-chamber, nor will crowds
assemble in the market-place to watch the cortège
of the <i>auto-da-fé</i>; but every year the famous
Procession of Penitents, which takes place on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
last Sunday of July, draws many strangers to
Furnes.</p>

<p>It is said in Bruges that the ghost of a Spanish
soldier, condemned to expiate eternally a foul
crime done at the bidding of the Holy Office,
walks at midnight on the Quai Vert, like Hamlet's
father on the terrace at Elsinore; and superstitious
people might well fancy that a spectre appears in
the market-place of Furnes on the summer's night
when the town is preparing for the annual ceremony.
The origin of the procession was this: In
the year 1650 a soldier named Mannaert, only
twenty-two years old, being in garrison at Furnes,
went to Confession and Communion in the Chapel
of the Capucins. After he had received the consecrated
wafer, he was persuaded by one of his
comrades, Mathurin Lejeusne, to take it out of his
mouth, wrap it in a cloth, and, on returning to his
lodging, fry it over a fire, under the delusion that
by reducing it to powder he would make himself
invulnerable. The young man was arrested, confessed
his guilt, and himself asked for punishment.
Condemned to be strangled, he heard the sentence
without a murmur, and went to his death singing
the penitential psalms. Soon afterwards Mathurin
Lejeusne, the instigator of the sacrilege, was
shot for some breach of military duty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
This was regarded as a proof of Divine justice, and the citizens
resolved that something must be done to appease
the wrath of God, which they feared would fall
upon their town because of the outrage done, as
they believed, to the body of His Son. A society
calling itself the 'Confrèrie de la Sodalité du
Sauveur Crucifié et de la Sainte Mère Marie, se
trouvant en douleur dessous la Croix, sur Mont
Calvaire,' had been formed a few years before at
Furnes, and the members now decided that a Procession
of Penitents should walk through the
streets every summer and represent to the people
the story of the Passion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_114fp.jpg" alt="NIEUPORT&mdash;

<p>Though the procession at Furnes is a thing of
yesterday compared to the Procession of the Holy
Blood at Bruges, it is far more suggestive of
mediævalism. The hooded faces of the penitents,
the quaint wooden figures representing Biblical
characters, the coarse dresses, the tawdry colours,
the strangely weird arrangement of the whole
business, take us back into the monkish superstitions
of the Dark Ages, with their mystery plays.
It is best seen from one of the windows of the
Spanish House, or from the balcony of the Hôtel
de Ville, on a sultry day, when the sky is heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
with black clouds, and thunder growls over the
plain of Flanders, and hot raindrops fall now and
then into the muddy streets. The first figure
which appears is a veiled penitent bearing the
standard of the Sodality. Then come, one after
another, groups of persons representing various
scenes in the Bible story, each group preceded by
a penitent carrying an inscription to explain what
follows. Abraham with his sword conducts Isaac
to the sacrifice on Mount Moriah. A penitent
holding the serpent and the cross walks before
Moses. Two penitents wearily drag a car on which
Joseph and Mary are seen seated in the stable at
Bethlehem. The four shepherds and the three
Magi follow. Then comes the flight into Egypt,
with Mary on an ass led by Joseph, the infant
Christ in her arms. Later we see the doctors of
the Temple walking in two rows, disputing with
the young Jesus in their midst. The triumphal
entry into Jerusalem is represented by a crowd of
schoolchildren waving palm-branches and singing
hosannahs round Jesus mounted on an ass. The
agony in the garden, Peter denying his Lord and
weeping bitterly, Jesus crowned with thorns, Pilate
in his judgment-hall, the Saviour staggering beneath
the cross, the Crucifixion itself, the Resurrection and
the Ascension, are all shown with the crude
realism of the Middle Ages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
There are penitents bearing ponderous crosses on their
shoulders, or carrying in their hands the whips, the nails, the
thorns, the veil of the Temple rent in twain, a
picture of the darkened sun, and other symbols of
the Passion. At the end, amidst torches and
incense and solemn chanting, the Host is exhibited
for the adoration of the crowd.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_116fp.jpg" alt="FURNES&mdash;

<p>Much of this spectacle is grotesque, and even
ludicrous; but there is also a great deal that is
terribly real, for the penitents are not actors playing
a part, but are all persons who have come to
Furnes for the purpose of doing penance. They
are disguised by the dark brown robes which cover
them from head to foot, so that they can see their
way only through the eyeholes in the hoods which
hide their faces; but as they pass silently along,
bending under the heavy crosses, or holding out
before them scrolls bearing such words as, 'All
they that see Me laugh Me to scorn,' 'They pierced
My hands and My feet,' or, 'See if there be any
sorrow like unto My sorrow,' there are glimpses
of delicate white hands grasping the hard wood
of the crosses, and of small, shapely feet bare
in the mud. What sighs, what tears and vain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
regrets, what secret tragedies of passion, guilt,
remorse, may not be concealed amongst the doleful
company who tread their own Via Dolorosa
on that pilgrimage of sorrow through the streets
of Furnes!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>NIEUPORT&mdash;THE BATTLE OF THE DUNES</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">O</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the morning of July 2, in the year 1600, two
armies&mdash;Spaniards, under the Archduke Albert,
and Dutchmen, under Prince Maurice of Nassau&mdash;stood
face to face amongst the dunes near Nieuport,
where the river Yser falls into the sea about ten
miles west from Ostend.</p>

<p>In a field to the east of Nieuport there is a high,
square tower, part of a monastery and church
erected by the Templars in the middle of the twelfth
century, which, though it escaped complete destruction,
was set on fire and nearly consumed when the
town was attacked and laid in ruins by the English
and the burghers of Ghent in 1383, the year of their
famous siege of Ypres. It is now in a half-ruinous
condition, but in July, 1600, it was an important
part of the fortifications, and from the top the
watchmen of the Spanish garrison could see the
country all round to a great distance beyond the
broad moat which then surrounded the strong walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of Nieuport. A few miles inland, to the southwest,
in the middle of the plain of Flanders, were
the houses of Furnes, grouped round the church
tower of St. Nicholas. To the north a wide belt of
sandhills (the 'dunes'), with the sea beyond them,
extended far past Ostend on the east, and to the
harbour of Dunkirk on the west. Nearer, on the
landward side of the dunes to the east, and within
less than a mile of each other, were the villages of
Westende and Lombaerdzyde. Close at hand, all
round Nieuport, there were numerous small lakes
and watercourses connected with the channel of the
Yser, which, flowing past the town, widened out
until it joined the sea, and became a harbour, which
on that morning was full of shipping.</p>

<p>A new chapter had just begun in the history
of West Flanders when the Dutchmen and the
Spaniards thus met to slaughter each other amongst
the sand and rushes of the dunes. Philip II. had
offered to cede the Spanish Netherlands to his
daughter, the Infanta Isabella, on condition that a
marriage was arranged between her and the Archduke
Albert of Austria. After the death of
Philip II. this offer was confirmed by his successor,
Philip III., and the wedding took place in April,
1599.</p>

<h3>NIEUPORT<br /><small>
A Fair Parishioner.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_120fp.jpg" alt="IllustNIEUPORT&mdash;

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></div>

<p>Albert and Isabella were both entering on the
prime of life, the Archduke being forty and the
Infanta thirty-two at the time of their marriage,
and were both of a character admirably fitted for
the lofty station to which they had been called.
In their portraits, which hang, very often frayed
and tarnished, on the walls of the Hôtel de Ville
of many a Flemish town, there is nothing very
royal or very attractive; but, even after making
every allowance for the flattery of contemporary
historians, there can be little doubt that their popularity
was well deserved&mdash;well deserved if even a
part of what has been said about them is true. The
Archduke is always said to have taken Philip II.
as a model of demeanour, but he had none of the
worst faults of the sullen, powerful despot, with
that small mind, that 'incredibly small' mind of
his, and cold heart, cold alike to human suffering
and human love, who had held the Flemings, whom
he hated, for so many years in the hollow of his
hand. His grave mien and reserved habits, probably
acquired during his sojourn at the Court of
Spain, were distasteful to the gay and pleasure-loving
people of Flanders, who would have preferred
a Prince more like Charles V., whose versatility
enabled him to adapt himself to the customs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of each amongst the various races over whom he
ruled. Nevertheless, if they did not love him they
respected him, and were grateful for the moderation
and good feeling which distinguished his reign, and
gave their distracted country, after thirty years of
civil war, a period of comparative tranquillity.</p>

<p>The Infanta Isabella, <i>débonnaire</i>, affable, tolerant,
and noble-hearted, as she is described, gained the
hearts of the Flemings as her husband never did.
'One could not find any Court more truly royal or
more brilliant in its public fêtes, which sometimes
recall the splendid epoch of the House of Burgundy.
Isabella loves a country life. She is often
to be seen on horseback, attending the tournaments,
leading the chase, flying the hawk, taking
part in the sports of the bourgeoise, shooting with
the crossbow, and carrying off the prize.' Above
all things, her works of charity endeared her to the
people. In time of war she established hospitals
for the wounded, for friends and enemies alike,
where she visited them, nursed them, and dressed
their wounds with her own hands, with heroic
courage and tenderness.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></div>

<p>Even on their first coming into Flanders, before
their characters were known except by hearsay, they
were received with extraordinary enthusiasm. Travelling
by way of vLuxembourg, they came to
Namur, where their first visit was made the occasion
of a military fête, conducted under the personal
supervision of Comte Florent de Berlaimont. At
Nivelles the Duc d'Arschot paid out of his own
purse the cost of the brilliant festivities to which
the people of Brabant flocked in order to bid their
new rulers welcome, and himself led the procession,
accompanied by the Archbishop of Malines and the
Bishop of Antwerp. So they journeyed on amidst
scenes of public rejoicing until they came to Brussels,
where they established their Court in accordance
with the customs and ceremonies which had
been usual under the Dukes of Burgundy and the
Kings of Spain.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_122fp.jpg" alt="NIEUPORT&mdash;

<p>But when the Archdukes, as they were called,
passed from town to town on this Royal progress,
the phantoms of war, pestilence, and famine hung
over the land. The great cities of Flanders had
been deserted by thousands of their inhabitants.
The sea trade of the country had been destroyed
by the vigorous blockade which the Dutch ships of
war maintained along the coast. Religious intolerance
had driven the most industrious of the working
classes to find a refuge in Holland or England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Villages lay in ruins, surrounded by untilled fields
and gardens run to seed. Silent looms and empty
warehouses were seen on every side. To such a
pass had the disastrous policy of the Escurial
brought this fair province of the Spanish Empire!
From all parts of Flanders the cry for peace went
up, but the time for peace was not yet come.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The new reign had just begun when Maurice of
Nassau suddenly invaded Flanders with a great
force, and laid siege to Nieuport, the garrison of
which, reinforced by an army, at the head of which
the Archduke Albert had hurried across Flanders,
was under the command of the Archduke himself,
and many Spanish Generals of great experience in
the wars.</p>

<p>Though the Court at Brussels had been taken by
surprise, the Dutch army was in a position of great
danger. Part of it lay on the west side of the
Yser, and part to the east, amongst the dunes near
Lombaerdzyde and Westende, with a bridge of
boats thrown across the river as their only connection.
Their ships were at anchor close to the
shore; but Prince Maurice frankly told his men
that it was useless to think of embarking in case of
defeat, and that, therefore, they must either win
the day or perish there, for the Spaniards were
before them under the protection of Nieuport, the
river divided them, the sea was behind them, and
it would be impossible for a beaten army to escape
by retreating through the dunes in the direction of
Ostend.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></div>

<p>Such was the position of affairs beneath the walls
of Nieuport at sunrise on July 2, 1600. The morning
was spent by the Dutch in preparing for battle.
Towards noon the Spanish leaders held a council
of war, at which it was decided to attack the enemy
as soon as possible, and about three o'clock the
battle began. A stiff breeze from the west, blowing
up the English Channel, drove clouds of sand into
the eyes of the Spaniards, and the bright rays of the
afternoon sun, shining in their faces as they advanced
to the attack, dazzled and confused them. But, in
spite of these disadvantages, it seemed at first as if
the fortunes of the day were to go in their favour.</p>

<p>The bridge of boats across the Yser was broken,
and some of the Dutch regiments, seized by a
sudden panic, began to retreat towards the sea;
but, finding it impossible to reach the ships, they
rallied, and began once more to fight with all the
dogged courage of their race. For some hours the
battle was continued with equal bravery on both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
sides, the Spaniards storming a battery which the
Dutch had entrenched amongst the dunes, and the
Dutch defending it so desperately that the dead
and wounded lay piled in heaps around it. But at
last the Spanish infantry were thrown into confusion
by a charge of horsemen; the Archduke
Albert was wounded, and had to retire from the
front to have his injuries attended to. Prince
Maurice ordered a general advance of all his army,
and in a few minutes the enemy were fleeing from
the battlefield, leaving behind them 3,000 dead,
800 prisoners, and more than 100 standards. The
loss on the Dutch side was about 2,000.</p>

<p>The Archduke Albert, who had narrowly escaped
being himself taken prisoner, succeeded in entering
Nieuport safely with what remained of his army.
The town remained in the hands of the Spaniards,
for Prince Maurice, after spending some days in vain
attempts to capture it, marched with his whole force
to Ostend, where soon afterwards began the celebrated
siege, which was to last for three long years,
and about which all Europe never tired of talking.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<h3>NIEUPORT<br /><small>
The Town Hall.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_126fp.jpg" alt="NIEUPORT&mdash;

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></div>

<p>The history of Nieuport since those days has
been the history of a gradual fall. Its sea trade
disappeared slowly but surely; the fishing industry
languished; the population decreased year by year;
and it has not shared to any appreciable extent in
the prosperity which has enriched other parts of
Flanders since the Revolution of 1830. It is now
a quiet, sleepy spot, with humble streets, which
remind one of some fishing village on the east
coast of Scotland. Men and women sit at the
doors mending nets or preparing bait. The boats,
with their black hulls and dark brown sails, move
lazily up to the landing-stages, where a few small
craft, trading along the coast, lie moored. Barges
heavily laden with wood are pulled laboriously
through the locks of the canals which connect the
Yser with Ostend and Furnes. The ancient fortifications
have long since disappeared, with the
exception of a few grass-grown mounds; and only
the grim tower of the Templars, standing by itself
in a field on the outskirts of the town, remains to
show that this insignificant place was once a mighty
stronghold.</p>

<p>In those old Flemish towns, however, it is always
possible to find something picturesque; and here
we have the Cloth Hall, with its low arches openin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
on the market-place, and the Gothic church,
one of the largest in Flanders, with its porch and
tower, where the bell-ringers play the chimes and
the people pass devoutly to the services of the
church. But that is all. Nieuport has few attractions
nowadays, and is chiefly memorable in Flemish
history because under its walls they fought that
bloody 'Battle of the Dunes,' in which the stubborn
strength and obstinacy of the Dutch overcame the
fiery valour of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>They are all well-nigh forgotten now, obstinate
Dutchman and valiant Spaniard alike. Amongst
the dunes not a vestige remains of the field-works
for which they fought. Bones, broken weapons and
shattered breastplates, and all the débris of the fight,
were long ago buried fathoms deep beneath mounds
of drifting sand. Old Nieuport&mdash;Nieuport Ville,
as they call it now&mdash;for which so much blood was
shed, is desolate and dreary with its small industries
and meagre commerce; but a short walk to the
north brings us to Nieuport-Bains, and to the gay
summer life which pulsates all along the Flemish
coast, from La Panne on the west to the frontiers
of Holland.</p>

of Bras-de-Fer, and Thierry d'Alsace, and Memlinc,
and Van Eyck, and Rubens, the land which was
at once the Temple and the Golgotha of Europe,
into the clear, broad light of modern days.</p>

<p>The Flemish coast, from the frontiers of France
to the frontiers of Holland, is throughout the same
in appearance. The sea rolls in and breaks upon
the yellow beach, which extends from east to west
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
for some seventy kilometres in an irregular line,
unbroken by rocks or cliffs. Above the beach are
the dunes, a long range of sandhills, tossed into all
sorts of queer shapes by the wind, on which nothing
grows but rushes or stunted Lombardy poplars,
and which reach their highest point, the Hoogen-Blekker,
about 100 feet above the sea, near Coxyde,
a fishing village four or five miles from Nieuport.
Behind the dunes a strip of undulating ground
('Ter Streep'), seldom more than a bare mile in
width, covered with scanty vegetation, moss, and
bushes, connects the barren sandhills with the
cultivated farms, green fields, and woodlands of the
Flemish plain. On the other side of the Channel
the chalk cliffs and rocky coast of England have
kept the waves in check; but the dunes were,
for many long years, the only barrier against the
encroachments of the sea on Flanders. They are,
however, a very weak defence against the storms of
autumn and winter. The sand drifts like snow
before the wind, and the outlines of these miniature
mountain ranges change often in a single night.
At one time, centuries ago, this part of Flanders,
which is now so bare, was, it is pretty clear, covered
by forests, the remains of which are still sometimes
found beneath the subsoil inland and under the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
When the great change came is unknown, but the
process was probably gradual. At an early period,
here, as in Holland, the fight against the invasions
of the sea began, and the first dykes are said to
have been constructed in the tenth century. The
first was known as the Evendyck, and ran from
Heyst to Wenduyne. Others followed, but they
were swept away, and now only a few traces of
them are to be found, buried beneath the sand and
moss.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<h3>THE DUNES<br /><small>
A Stormy Evening.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_130fp.jpg" alt="THE DUNES&mdash;
A Stormy Evening." width="600" height="389" /></div>

<p>The wild storms of the tenth, eleventh, and
twelfth centuries changed the aspect of the coast
of Flanders. Nieuport rose in consequence of one
of these convulsions of Nature, when the inhabitants
of Lombaerdzyde, which was then a seaport,
were driven by the tempests to the inland village
of Santhoven, the name of which they changed to
'Neoportus'&mdash;the new harbour. This was in the
beginning of the twelfth century, and thenceforth
the struggle against the waves went on incessantly.
Lands were granted by Thierry d'Alsace on condition
that the owner should construct dykes, and
Baldwin of Constantinople appointed guardians of
the shore, charged with the duty of watching the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
sea and constructing defensive works. But the
struggle was carried on under the utmost difficulties.
In the twelfth century the sea burst in
with resistless force upon the low-lying ground,
washing away the dunes and swallowing up whole
towns. The inroads of the waves, the heavy rains,
and the earthquakes, made life so unendurable that
there were thousands who left their homes and
emigrated to Germany.</p>

<p>Later, in the thirteenth century, there was a
catastrophe of appalling dimensions, long known
as the 'Great Storm,' when 40,000 Flemish men
and women perished. This was the same tempest
which overran the Dutch coast, and formed the
Zuyder Zee, those 1,400 square miles of water
which the Dutch are about to reclaim and form
again into dry land. In the following century the
town of Scarphout, in West Flanders, was overwhelmed,
and the inhabitants built a new town
for themselves on higher ground, and called it
Blankenberghe, which is now one of the most
important watering-places on the coast.</p>

<p>Ever since those days this constant warfare
against the storms has continued, and the sea
appears to be bridled; but anyone who has watched
the North Sea at high tide on a stormy day beating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
on the shores of Flanders, and observed how the
dunes yield to the pressure of the wind and waves,
and crumble away before his eyes, must come to
the conclusion that the peril of the ocean is not yet
averted, and can understand the meaning of the
great modern works, the <i>digues de mer</i>, or sea-fronts,
as they would be called in England, which
are being gradually constructed at such immense
cost all along the coast.</p>

<p>A most interesting and, indeed, wonderful thing
in the recent history of the Netherlands is the
rapid development of the Flemish littoral from a
waste of sand, with here and there a paltry fishing
hamlet and two or three small towns, into a great
cosmopolitan pleasure resort. Seventy-five years
ago, when Belgium became an independent country,
and King Leopold I. ascended the throne, Ostend
and Nieuport were the only towns upon the coast
which were of any size; but Ostend was then a
small fortified place, with a harbour wholly unsuited
for modern commerce, and Nieuport, in a
state of decadence, though it possessed a harbour,
was a place of no importance. To-day the whole
coast is studded with busy watering-places, about
twenty of them, most of which have come into
existence within the last fifteen years, with a resident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
population of about 60,000, which is raised by
visitors in summer to, it is said, nearly 125,000.
The dunes, which the old Counts of Flanders
fought so hard to preserve from the waves, and
which were at the beginning of the present century
mere wastes of sand, a sort of 'no man's land',
of little or no use except for rabbit-shooting, are
now valuable properties, the price of which is
rising every year.</p>

<p>The work of turning the sand into gold, for that
is what the development of the Flemish coast
comes to, has been carried out partly by the State
and partly by private persons. In early times this
belt of land upon the margin of the sea was held
by the Counts of Flanders, who treated the ridge
of sandhills above high-water mark as a natural
rampart against the waves, and granted large tracts
of the flat ground which lay behind to various
religious houses. At the French Revolution these
lands were sold as Church property at a very low
figure, and were afterwards allowed, in many cases,
to fall out of cultivation by the purchasers. So
great a portion of the district was sold that at the
present time only a small portion of the dune land
is the property of the State&mdash;the narrow strip between
Mariakerke and Middelkerke on the west of Ostend, and that
which lies between Ostend and Blankenberghe on the east.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

The larger portions, which are possessed by private owners,
are partly the property of the descendants of those who
bought them at the Revolution, and partly of
building societies, incorporated for the purpose of
developing what Mr. Hall Caine once termed the
'Visiting Industry'&mdash;that is to say, the trade in
tourists and seaside visitors.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h3>AN OLD FARMER</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_134fp.jpg" alt="AN OLD FARMER" width="600" height="443" /></div>

<p>Plage de Westende, Le Coq, and Duinbergen&mdash;three
charming summer resorts&mdash;have been created
by building societies. Nieuport-Bains and La
Panne have been developed by the owners of the
adjoining lands, the families of Crombez and Calmeyn.
Wenduyne, on the other hand, which lies
between Le Coq and Blankenberghe, has been made
by the State, while the management of Blankenberghe,
Heyst, and Middelkerke, as bathing stations,
is in the hands of their communal councils.</p>

<p>On the coast of Flanders, Ostend&mdash;'La Reine
des Plages'&mdash;is, it need hardly be said, the most
important place, and its rise has been very remarkable.
Less than fifty years ago the population was
in all about 15,000. During the last fifteen years
it has increased by nearly 15,000, and now amounts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to about 40,000 in round numbers. The increase
in the number of summer visitors has been equally
remarkable. In the year 1860 the list of strangers
contained 9,700 names; three years ago it contained
no less than 42,000. This floating population
of foreign visitors who come to Ostend is
cosmopolitan to an extent unknown at any watering-place
in England. In 1902 11,000 English,
8,000 French, 5,000 Germans, and 2,000 Americans
helped to swell the crowds who walked on the sea-front,
frequented the luxurious and expensive
hotels, or left their money on the gaming-tables at
the Kursaal. On one day&mdash;August 15, 1902&mdash;7,000
persons bathed.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Blankenberghe, with its 30,000 summer visitors,
comes next in importance to Ostend, while both
Heyst and Middelkerke are crowded during the
season. But the life at these towns is not so agreeable
as at the smaller watering-places. The hotels
are too full, and have, as a rule, very little except
their cheapness to recommend them. There is
usually a body calling itself the <i>comité des fêtes</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the members of which devote themselves for two
months every summer to devising amusements,
sports, and competitions of various kinds, instead
of leaving people to amuse themselves in their own
way, so that hardly a day passes on which the
strains of a second-rate band are not heard in the
local Kursaal, or a night which is not made hideous
by a barrel-organ, to which the crowd is dancing
on the <i>digue</i>. At the smaller places, however,
though these also have their <i>comités des fêtes</i>, one
escapes to a great extent from these disagreeable
surroundings.</p>

<p>May, June, and September are the pleasantest
months upon the coast of Flanders, for the visitors
are not so numerous, and even in mid-winter the
dunes are worth a visit. Then the hotels and villas
fronting the sea are closed, and their windows
boarded up. The bathing-machines are removed
from the beach, and stand in rows in some sheltered
spot. The <i>digue</i>, a broad extent of level brickwork,
is deserted, and the wind sweeps along it, scattering
foam and covering it with sand and sprays of
tangled seaweed. The mossy surface of the dunes
is frozen hard as iron, and often the hailstones rush
in furious blasts before the wind. For league after
league there is not a sign of life, except the seabirds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
flying low near the shore, or the ships rising
and falling in the waves far out to sea. In the
winter months the coast of Flanders is bleak and
stormy, but the air in these solitudes is as health-giving
as in any other part of Europe.</p>

<p>Of late years the Government, represented by
Comte de Smet de Naeyer, has bestowed much
attention on the development of the littoral, and
King Leopold II. has applied his great business
talents to the subject. Large sums of money have
been voted by the Belgian Parliament for the construction
of public works and the extension of the
means of communication from place to place.
There is a light railway, the 'Vicinal,' which runs
along the whole coast, at a short distance from the
shore, from Knocke, on the east, to La Panne in
the extreme west, and which is connected with the
system of State railways at various points. From
Ostend, through Middelkerke, to Plage de Westende,
an electric railway has been constructed, close
to the beach and parallel to the Vicinal (which is
about a mile inland), on which trains run every ten
minutes during the summer season. As an instance
of the speed and energy with which these works
for the convenience of the public are carried out,
when once they have been decided upon, it may be mentioned
that the contract for the portion of the electric line
between Middelkerke and Plage de Westende, a distance of
about a mile and a half, was signed on May 9,
that five days later 200 workmen
began to cut through the dunes, embank and lay
the permanent way, and that on June 25, in spite
of several interruptions owing to drifting sand and
heavy rains, the first train of the regular service
arrived at Plage de Westende.</p>

<h3>LA PANNE<br /><small>Interior of a Flemish Inn.</small></h3>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></div>

<p>A large sum, amounting to several millions of
francs, is voted every year for the protection of the
shores of Flanders against the encroachments of the
sea, by the construction of these solid embankments
of brickwork and masonry, which will, in
the course of a few years, extend in an unbroken
line along the whole coast from end to end. The
building of these massive sea-walls is a work of
great labour and expense, for what seems to be an
impregnable embankment, perhaps 30 feet high and
90 feet broad, solid and strong enough to resist the
most violent breakers, will be undermined and fall
to pieces in a few hours, if not made in the proper
way. A <i>digue</i>, no matter how thick, which rests
on the sand alone will not last. A thick bed of
green branches bound together must first be laid
down as a foundation: this is strengthened by posts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
driven through it into the sand. Heavy timbers,
resting on bundles of branches lashed together, are
wedged into the foundations, and slope inwards
and upwards to within a few feet of the height to
which it is intended to carry the <i>digue</i>. On the
top another solid bed of branches is laid down, and
the whole is first covered with concrete, and then
with bricks or tiles, while the edge of the <i>digue</i>, at
the top of the seaward slope, is composed of heavy
blocks of stone cemented together and bound by
iron rivets.</p>

<p><i>Digues</i> made in this solid fashion, all of them
higher above the shore than the Thames Embankment
is above the river, and some of them broader
than the Embankment, will, before very many
years have passed, stretch along the whole coast of
Flanders without a break, and will form not only a
defence against the tides, but a huge level promenade,
with the dunes on one side and the sea on
the other. This is a gigantic undertaking, but it
will be completed during the lifetime of the present
generation.</p>

<h3>LA PANNE<br /><small>A Flemish Inn&mdash;Playing Skittles.</small></h3>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></div>

<p>Another grandiose idea, which is actually being
carried into effect, is to connect all the seaside
resorts on the coast of Flanders by a great boulevard,
40 yards wide, with a road for carriages and pedestrians,
a track for motor-cars and bicycles, and
an electric railway, all side by side. Large portions
of this magnificent roadway, which is to be known
as the 'Route Royale,' have already been completed
between Blankenberghe and Ostend, and from
Ostend to Plage de Westende. From Westende
it will be continued to Nieuport-Bains, crossing the
Yser by movable bridges, and thence to La Panne,
and so onwards, winding through the dunes, over
the French borders, and perhaps as far as Paris!</p>

<p>A single day's journey through the district which
this 'Route Royale' is to traverse will lead the
traveller through the most interesting part of the
dunes, and introduce him to most of the favourite
<i>plages</i> on the coast of Flanders, and thus give
him an insight into many characteristic Flemish
scenes. La Panne, for instance, and Adinkerque,
in the west and on the confines of France, are
villages inhabited by fishermen who have built their
dwellings in sheltered places amongst the dunes.
The low white cottages of La Panne, with the
strings of dried fish hanging on the walls, nestle in
the little valley from which the place takes its
name (for <i>panne</i> in Flemish means 'a hollow'),
surrounded by trees and hedges, gay with wild
roses in the summer-time. Each cottage stands in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
its small plot of garden ground, and most of the
families own fishing-boats of their own, and farm a
holding which supplies them with potatoes and
other vegetables.</p>

<p>For a long time these cottages were the only
houses at La Panne, which was seldom visited,
except by a few artists; but about fifteen years
ago the surveyors and the architects made their
appearance, paths and roads were laid out, and, as
if by magic, cottages and villas and the inevitable
<i>digue de mer</i> have sprung up on the dunes near
the sea, and not very far from the original village.
The chief feature of the new La Panne is that the
houses are, except those on the sea-front, built on
the natural levels of the ground, some perched on
the tops of the dunes, and others in the hollows
which separate them. The effect is extremely
picturesque, and the example of the builders of
La Panne is being followed at other places, notably
at Duinbergen, one of the very latest bathing
stations, which has risen during the last three years
about a mile to the east of Heyst.</p>

<p>Another very interesting place is the Plage de
Westende, the present terminus of the electric
railway from Ostend. The old village of Westende
lies a mile inland on the highway between Nieuport
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and Ostend, close to the scene of the Battle of the
Dunes. This Plage is, indeed, a model seaside
resort, with a <i>digue</i> which looks down upon a shore
of the finest sand, and from which, of an evening,
one sees the lights of Ostend in the east, and the
revolving beacon at Dunkirk shining far away to
the west. The houses which front the sea, all
different from each other, are in singularly good
taste; and behind them are a number of detached
cottages and villas, large and small, in every variety
of design. Ten years ago the site of this little
town was a rabbit warren; now everything is up
to date: electric light in every house, perfect
drainage, a good water-supply, tennis courts, and
an admirable hotel, where even the passing stranger
feels at home. Though only three-quarters of an
hour from noisy, crowded, bustling Ostend by the
railway, it is one of the quietest and most comfortable
places on the coast of Flanders, and can be
reached by travellers from England in a few hours.</p>

<p>Some years hence the lovely, peaceful Plage de
Westende may have grown too big, but when the
sand has all been turned into gold, and when the
contractors and builders have grown rich, those
who have known Westende in its earlier days will
think of it as the quiet spot about which at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
time only a few people used to stroll; where perhaps
the poet Verhaeren found something to inspire
him; where many a long summer's evening was
spent in pleasant talk on history, and painting, and
music by a little society of men and women who
spoke French, or German, or English, as the fancy
took them, and laughed, and quoted, and exchanged
ideas on every subject under the sun; where the
professor of music once argued, and sprang up to
prove his point by playing&mdash;but that is an allusion,
or, as Mr. Kipling would say, 'another story.'</p>

<p>The district in which Westende lies, with Lombaerdzyde,
Nieuport, Furnes, and Coxyde close
together, is the most interesting on the coast of
Flanders. Le Coq, on the other hand, is in that
part of the dune country which has least historical
interest, and is chiefly known as the place where
the Royal Golf Club de Belgique has its course.
It is only twenty minutes from Ostend on the
Vicinal railway, which has a special station for
golfers near the Club House. There is no <i>digue</i>,
and the houses are dotted about in a valley behind
the dunes. This place has a curious resemblance
to a Swiss village.</p>

<p>A few years ago the owners of lands upon the
Flemish littoral began to grasp the fact that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
was a sport called golf, on which Englishmen were
in the habit of spending money, and that it would
be an addition to the attractions of Ostend if,
beside the racecourse, there was a golf-course.
King Leopold, who is said to contemplate using all
the land between the outskirts of Ostend and Le
Coq for sporting purposes, paid a large sum, very
many thousands of francs, out of his own pocket,
and the golf-links at Le Coq were laid out. The
Club House is handsome and commodious, but,
unfortunately, the course itself, which is the main
thing, is not very satisfactory, being far too
artificial. The natural 'bunkers' were filled up,
and replaced by ramparts and ditches like those on
some inland courses in England. On the putting
greens the natural undulations of the ground have
been levelled, and the greens are all as flat and
smooth as billiard-tables. There are clumps of
ornamental wood, flower-beds, and artificial ponds
with goldfish swimming in them. It is all very
pretty, but it is hardly golf. What with the
'Grand Prix d'Ostende,' the 'Prix des Roses,' the
'Prix des Ombrelles, handicap libre, réservé aux
Dames,' the 'Grand Prix des Dames,' and a
number of other <i>objets d'art</i>, which are offered
for competition on almost every day from the be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>ginning
of June to the end of September, this is a
perfect paradise for the pot-hunter and his familiar
friend Colonel Bogey. Real golf, the strenuous
game, which demands patience and steady nerves,
perhaps, more than any other outdoor game, is not
yet quite understood by many Belgians; but the
bag of clubs is every year becoming more common
on the Dover mail-boats.</p>

<p>Most of these golf-bags find their way to Knocke,
where many of the English colony at Bruges spend
the summer, and which, as the coast of Flanders
becomes better known, is visited every year by
increasing numbers of travellers from the other side
of the Channel. Knocke is in itself one of the
least attractive places on the Flemish littoral. The
old village, a nondescript collection of houses,
lies on the Vicinal railway about a mile from the
sea, which is reached by a straight roadway, and
where there is a <i>digue</i>, numerous hotels, pensions,
and villas, all of which are filled to overflowing in
the season. The air, indeed, is perfect, and there
are fine views from the <i>digue</i> and the dunes of the
island of Walcheren, Flushing, and the estuary of
the Scheldt; but the place was evidently begun
with no definite plan: the dunes were ruthlessly
levelled, and the result is a few unlovely streets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and a number of detached houses standing in disorder
amidst surroundings from which everything
that was picturesque has long since departed.</p>

<p>But the dunes to the east are wide, and enclose
a large space of undulating ground; and here the
Bruges Golf and Sports Club has its links, which
present a very complete contrast to the Belgian
course at Le Coq. The links at Knocke, if somewhat
rough and ready, are certainly sporting in the
highest degree. Some of the holes, those in what
is known as the Green Valley, are rather featureless;
but in the other parts of the course there are
numerous natural hazards, bunkers, and hillocks
thick with sand and rushes. It has no pretentions
to be a 'first-class' course (for one thing, it is too
short), but in laying out the eighteen holes the
ground has been utilized to the best advantage, and
the Royal and Ancient game flourishes more at
Knocke than at any other place in Belgium. The
owners of the soil and the hotel-keepers, with
a keen eye to business, and knowing that the
golfing alone brings the English, from whom they
reap a golden harvest, to Knocke, do all in their
power to encourage the game, and it is quite
possible that before long other links may be established
along the coast. The soil of the strip behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the dunes is not so suitable for golf as the close
turf of St. Andrews, North Berwick, or Prestwick,
for in many places it consists of sand with a slight
covering of moss; but with proper treatment it
could probably be improved and hardened. It is
merely a question of money, and money will certainly
be forthcoming if the Government, the
communes, and the private owners once see that
this form of amusement will add to the popularity
of the littoral.</p>

<p>A short mile's walk to the west of Knocke brings
us to Duinbergen, one of the newest of the Flemish
<i>plages</i>, founded in the year 1901 by the Société
Anonyme de Duinbergen, a company in which
some members of the Royal Family are said to
hold shares. At Knocke and others of the older
watering-places everything was sacrificed to the
purpose of making money speedily out of every
available square inch of sand, and the first thing
done was to destroy the dunes. But at Duinbergen
the good example set by the founders of La Panne
has been followed and improved upon, and nothing
could be more <i>chic</i> than this charming little place,
which was planned by Herr Stübben, of Cologne,
an architect often employed by the King of the
Belgians, whose idea was to create a small garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149-50]</a></span>
city among the dunes. The dunes have been carefully
preserved; the roads and pathways wind round
them; most of the villas and cottages have been
erected in places from which a view of the sea can
be obtained; and even the <i>digue</i> has been built in
a curve in order to avoid the straight line, which is
apt to give an air of monotony to the rows of villas,
however picturesque they may be in themselves,
which face the sea at other places. So artistic is
the appearance of the houses that the term 'Style
Duinbergen' is used by architects to describe it.
Electric lighting, a copious supply of water rising
by gravitation to the highest houses, and a complete
system of drainage, add to the luxuries and
comforts of this <i>plage</i>, which is one of the best illustrations
of the wonders which have been wrought
among the dunes by that spirit of enterprise which
has done so much for modern Flanders during the
last few years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>COXYDE&mdash;THE SCENERY OF THE DUNES</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> whole of the coast-line is within the province
of West Flanders, and its development in recent
years is the most striking fact in the modern history
of the part of Belgium with which this volume
deals. The change which has taken place on the
littoral during the last fifteen or twenty years is
extraordinary, and the contrast between the old
Flanders and the new, between the Flanders which
lingers in the past and the Flanders which marches
with the times, is brought vividly before us by
the difference between such mediæval towns as
Bruges, Furnes, or Nieuport, and the bright
new places which glitter on the sandy shores of
the Flemish coast. But in almost every corner
of the dunes, close to these signs of modern
progress, there is something to remind us of that
past history which is, after all, the great charm of
Flanders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
One of the most characteristic spots in the land
of the dunes is the village of Coxyde, which lies
low amongst the sandhills, about five miles west
from Nieuport, out of sight of the sea, but inhabited
by a race of fisherfolk who, curiously
enough, pursue their calling on horseback. Mounted
on their little horses, and carrying baskets and nets
fastened to long poles, they go into the sea to catch
small fish and shrimps. It is strange to see them
riding about in the water, sometimes in bands, but
more frequently alone or in pairs; and this curious
custom, which has been handed down from father
to son for generations, is peculiar to the part of the
coast which lies between La Panne and the borders
of France.</p>

<p>Near Coxyde, and at the corner where the
road from Furnes turns in the direction of La
Panne, is a piece of waste ground which travellers
on the Vicinal railway pass without notice.
But here once stood the famous Abbey of the
Dunes.</p>

<p>In the first years of the twelfth century a pious
hermit named Lyger took up his abode in these
solitary regions, built a dwelling for himself, and
settled down to spend his life in doing good works
and in the practice of religion. Soon, as others
gathered round him, his dwelling grew into a
monastery, and at last, in the year 1122, the Abbey
of the Dunes was founded. It was nearly half a
century before the great building, which is said to
have been the first structure of such a size built of
brick in Flanders, was completed; but when at last
the work was done the Abbey was, by all accounts,
one of the most magnificent religious houses in
Flanders, consisting of a group of buildings with
no less than 105 windows, a rich and splendid
church, so famous for its ornamental woodwork
that the carvings of the stalls were reproduced in
the distant Abbey of Melrose in Scotland, and a
library which, as time went on, became a storehouse
of precious manuscripts and hundreds of those
wonderfully illustrated missals on which the monks
of the Middle Ages spent so many laborious
hours. We can imagine them in the cells of
Coxyde copying and copying for hours together,
or bending over the exquisitely coloured drawings
which are still preserved in the museums of
Flanders.</p>

<p>But their most useful work was done on the
lands which lay round the Abbey. There were at
Coxyde in the thirteenth century no fewer than
150 monks and 248 converts engaged at one time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in cultivating the soil.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> They drained the marshes,
and planted seeds where seeds would grow, until,
after years of hard labour on the barren ground,
the Abbey of the Dunes was surrounded by wide
fields which had been reclaimed and turned into a
fertile oasis in the midst of that savage and inhospitable
desert.</p>


<p>When St. Bernard was preaching the Crusade
in Flanders he came to Coxyde. On his advice the
monks adopted the Order of the Cistercians, and
their first abbot under the new rule afterwards sat
in the chair of St. Bernard himself as Abbot of
Clairvaux. Thereafter the Cistercian Abbey of
the Dunes grew in fame, especially under the rule
of St. Idesbaldus, who had come there from
Furnes, where he had been a Canon of the Church
of Ste. Walburge. 'It has also a special interest
for English folk. It long held lands in the isle of
Sheppey, as well as the advowson of the church
of Eastchurch, in the same island. These were
bestowed on it by Richard the Lion-Hearted. The
legend says that these gifts were made to reward
its sixth abbot, Elias, for the help he gave in releasing
Richard from captivity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Anyhow, Royal charters, and dues from the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and a Bull of Pope Celestine III., confirmed
the Abbey in its English possessions and privileges.
The Abbey seems to have derived little benefit
from these, and finally, by decision of a general
congregation of the Cistercian Order, handed them
over to the Abbot and Chapter of Bexley, to recoup
the latter for the cost of entertaining monks
of the Order going abroad, or returning from the
Continent, on business of the Order.'<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_154fp.jpg" alt="COXYDE&mdash;
A shrimper" width="393" height="600" /></div>

<p>The English invasion of the fifteenth century
destroyed the work of the monks in their fields
and gardens, but the Abbey itself was spared; and
the great disaster did not come until a century
later, when the image-breakers, who had begun
their work amongst the Gothic arches of Antwerp,
spread over West Flanders, and descended upon
Coxyde. The Abbey was attacked, and the monks
fled to Bruges, carrying with them many of their
treasures, which are still to be seen in the collection
on the Quai de la Poterie, beyond the
bridge which is called the Pont des Dunes. The
noble building, so long the home of so much piety
and learning, and from which so many generations
of apostles had gone forth to toil in the fields and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
minister to the poor, was abandoned, and allowed
to fall into ruins, until at last it gradually sunk into
complete decay, and was buried beneath the sands.
Not a trace of it now remains. History has few
more piteous sermons to preach on the vanity of all
the works of men.</p>

<p>The fishermen on the coast of Flanders have,
from remote times, paid their vows in the hour of
danger to Notre Dame de Lombaerdzyde. If they
escape from some wild storm they go on a pilgrimage
of thanksgiving. They walk in perfect silence
along the road to the shrine, for not a word must
be spoken till they reach it; and these hardy seafaring
men may be seen kneeling at the altar of the
old, weather-beaten church which stands on the
south side of the highway through the village, and
in which are wooden models of ships hung up as
votive offerings before an image of the Virgin,
which is the object of peculiar veneration. The
Madonna of Lombaerdzyde did not prevail to keep
the sea from invading the village at the time when
the inhabitants were driven to Nieuport, but the
belief in her miraculous power is as strong to-day
as it was in the Dark Ages.</p>

<h3>ADINKERQUE<br /><small>
Village and Canal.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_156fp.jpg" alt="ADINKERQUE&mdash;

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></div>

<p> There is a view of Lombaerdzyde which no one
strolling on the dunes near Nieuport should fail to
see&mdash;a perfect picture, as typical of the scenery in
these parts as any landscape chosen by Hobbema
or Ruysdael. A causeway running straight between
two lofty dunes of bare sand, and bordered
by stunted trees, forms a long vista at the end of
which Lombaerdzyde appears&mdash;a group of red-roofed
houses, with narrow gables and white walls,
and in the middle the pointed spire of the church,
beyond which the level plain of Flanders, dotted
with other villages and churches and trees in formal
rows, stretches away into the distance until it
merges in the horizon. Adinkerque, a picturesque
village beyond Furnes, is another place which calls
to mind many a picture of the Flemish artists in
the Musée of Antwerp and the Mauritshuis at The
Hague; and the recesses of the dune country in
which these places are hidden has a wonderful
fascination about it&mdash;the irregular outlines of the
dunes, some high and some low, sinking here into
deep hollows of firm sand, and rising there into
strange fantastic shapes, sometimes with sides like
small precipices on which nothing can grow, and
sometimes sloping gently downwards and covered
with trembling poplars, spread in confusion on
every side. Often near the shore the sandy barrier
has been broken down by the wind or by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
waves, and a long gulley formed, which cuts deep
into the dunes, and through which the sand drifts
inland till it reaches a steep bank clothed with
rushes, against which it heaps itself, and so, rising
higher with the storms of each winter, forms
another dune. This process has been going on
for ages. The sands are for ever shifting, but moss
begins to grow in sheltered spots; such wild flowers
as can flourish there bloom and decay; the poplars
shed their leaves, and nourish by imperceptible
degrees the fibres of the moss; some hardy grasses
take root; and at length a scanty greensward appears.
By such means slowly, in the microcosm
of the dunes, have been evolved out of the changing
sands places fit for men to live in, until now
along the strip which guards the coast of Flanders
there are green glades gay with flowers, and shady
dells, and gardens sheltered from the wind, plots of
pasture-land, cottages and churches which seem
to grow out of the landscape, their colouring so
harmonizes with the colouring which surrounds
them. And ever, close at hand, the sea is rolling
in and falling on the shore. 'Come unto these
yellow sands,' and when the sun is going down,
casting a long bar of burnished gold across the
water, against which, perhaps, the sail of some boat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
looms dark for a moment and then passes on, the
sky glows in such a lovely, tender light that those
who watch it must needs linger till the twilight is
fading away before they turn their faces inland.
There are few evenings for beauty like a summer
evening on the shores of Flanders.</p>

<h2>EAST FLANDERS AND BRABANT</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>GHENT</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">F</span><span class="smcap">rom</span> Bruges, the capital of West Flanders, to
Ghent, the capital of East Flanders, it is only half
an hour's journey by rail; but the contrast between
them is remarkable. Bruges is a city of the dead,
of still life, of stagnant waters, of mouldering walls
and melancholy streets, long since fallen from its
high estate into utter decay. Ghent, on the other
hand, is active, bustling, prosperous. The narrow
lanes and gloomy courts of mediæval times have,
in many parts, been swept away to make room for
broad, well-lighted streets and squares, through
which electric trams, crowded with busy people,
run incessantly all day long. Bruges is known as
'La Morte.' Ghent is often called 'La Ville de
Flore,' from the numerous gardens and hot-houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
which supply plants to the markets of France,
Germany, America, and other countries. Other
branches of industry thrive. The trade in flax,
linen, leather goods, engines, and lace, is large and
flourishing. There are warehouses packed full of
articles of commerce waiting to be sent off by
canal or railway, and yards piled high with wood
from North America, or bags of Portland cement
from England.</p>

<p>Two great canals, one connecting the town with
the estuary of the Scheldt near the sea, and the
other leading, through Bruges, to Ostend, admit
merchant vessels and huge barges to a commodious
harbour, where steam cranes and all the appliances
of a busy seaport are in full swing. There never
is a crowd in Bruges, except during the yearly
Procession of the Holy Blood; but every day in
Ghent, if by chance a drawbridge over one of the
canals is raised, a crowd of working people gathers
to wait impatiently while some deeply-laden barge
passes slowly through, and, the moment the passage
is free, rushes over in haste. These are Flemings
in a hurry. One never sees them in Bruges.</p>

<p>Ghent, then, is a modern commercial town; but,
in spite of all the changes which time and progress
have brought about, it is, like most of the other
Flemish towns, full of sights which carry us back
in a moment to the distant past.</p>

<h3>GHENT<br /><small>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></div>

<p>The Lys and the Scheldt, winding through
Belgium from west to east, meet almost in the
centre of the province of East Flanders; and at
the point where they join a number of islands have
been formed by numerous channels, pools, and
backwaters which are connected with the two
rivers. In early times, no doubt, the spot was
nothing but a morass, and on one of the pieces of
drier ground the first wooden houses of Ghent were
erected. After that, during the course of centuries,
the town spread from island to island, and
as each island was occupied a bridge was built, so
that by degrees between twenty and thirty islands,
joined by a number of bridges, were covered with
dwelling-houses and public buildings, and the whole
surrounded by a wall and moat.</p>

<p>But long before buildings of brick or stone replaced
the dark wooden houses, of which only one
now remains, the people of Ghent had acquired
the character of being the most intractable of all
the Flemings; and when Philip of Alsace, Count
of Flanders, came back from the Holy Land,
towards the end of the twelfth century, he erected,
on the site of an old fortress which Baldwin Bras
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
-de-Fer had built 200 years before, a strong castle
for the purpose of overawing the townsmen.</p>

<p>On the left bank of the Lys, which, passing
through the middle of the town, threads its way
close under the basements of the houses, is the
Place Ste. Pharailde, with its picturesque buildings
of the Middle Ages; and on the north side of this
Place stand the massive remains of the old stronghold.</p>

<p>It is a grim, forbidding place, now known as the
Château des Comtes. On three sides high black
walls rise straight out of the water, and on the
fourth side a deep archway leads into a large
courtyard, in the middle of which is the donjon,
said to date from the ninth century. There is a
vast, dim banquet-hall, with an immense chimney-piece,
and small windows with stone seats sunk
deep in the walls, where King Edward III. of
England and Queen Philippa feasted with Jacques
van Artevelde in the year 1339, during the war
with France. Dark, narrow staircases lead from
story to story within the thickness of the walls, or
wind up through turrets pierced with small windows
a few inches square. Far down in the foundations
are dismal oubliettes and torture-chambers; and in
one corner of what is supposed to have been a prison
is an iron-bound chest full of the skeletons
of persons who suffered in the religious troubles
of the sixteenth century. This gloomy place, once
the abode of so much cruelty, is one of the most
interesting sights in Ghent.</p>

<p>Charles V. was born at Ghent in the Cour des
Princes, a magnificent palace, of which nothing
but a single gateway now remains. John of Gaunt
(or Ghent) was born here, too. Here took place
the marriage of the Archduke Maximilian to Mary
of Burgundy, which gave the Netherlands to the
House of Austria. And here, in the Carthusian
monastery in the Rue des Chartreux, in a room
which is now one of the refectories, Lord Gambier,
as Ambassador for George III., signed, on Christmas
Eve, 1814, the articles of peace which put an end
to the war between Great Britain and the United
States of America.</p>

<p>Everywhere, however, in Flanders the chief connecting-link
between the past and the present is to
be found at the Hôtel de Ville, the centre of the
civic life; and it would be hard to find in all the
Netherlands, except at Brussels, a more splendid
example of Gothic architecture than the north side
of the Hôtel de Ville at Ghent.</p>

<p>Within, on the walls of a great hall, the Salle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
des États, is a tablet in memory of the famous
'Pacification of Ghent,' signed there in 1576, when
the leaders of the Dutch and Catholic Netherlands
united for the purpose of securing civil and religious
liberty and the downfall of the Spanish oppression.
Opposite this tablet is a window, through which
one steps on to a small balcony where proclamations
were made of war, or peace, or royal marriages,
and laws were promulgated, in olden times. In
another part of the building the twelve Catholics,
thirteen Liberals, and fourteen Socialists, who (1907)
make up the Council of to-day, meet and debate,
in a Gothic hall of the fifteenth century, with the
Burgomaster in the chair. The civil marriages,
which by the Belgian Constitution of 1831 must
always precede the religious ceremony in church,
take place in an old chapel of 1574, where there is
a large picture by Wauters of Mary of Burgundy
asking the burghers of Ghent to pardon one of her
Ministers. Just outside the door of this Salle des
Mariages a painting of the last moments of Count
Egmont and Count Horn hangs in a passage, with
a roof 500 years old, leading to the offices of the
Tramway Company. Thus the everyday business
of the town is conducted in the midst of the
memorials of the past.</p>

<h3>GHENT<br /><small>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></div>

<p>In front of the balcony of the Hôtel de Ville
there used to be a wide, open space, in which the
burghers assembled; but now the ground is occupied
by a row of houses (the Rue Haut-Port),
intersected by narrow streets, one of which leads to
the Marché de Vendredi, the scene of the greatest
events in the history of Ghent. This is a large
square, surrounded by a double row of trees, in the
middle of which is a statue of Jacques van Artevelde,
the 'Brewer of Ghent,' who stands with arm up-raised,
pointing to the west, as if to show his
fellow-citizens that help was coming from England,
or that the enemy was on the march from France.</p>

<p>Not far from the Hôtel de Ville the compact
tower of St. Nicholas rises above the housetops;
and the churches of St. Pierre, St. Michael, and
St. Jacques are worth a visit. There is also the
Béguinage de Ste. Élisabeth, a group of houses of
dark red brick with tiled roofs, trim grass paddocks,
and winding streets, clustering round a church&mdash;the
quietest spot in Ghent, where five or six
hundred Beguines, in their blue robes and white
head-dresses, spend their days in making lace or
attending the services of the Catholic Church.
But the antiquary and student of history will find
more to interest him if he makes his way to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Abbey of St. Bavon (birthplace of John of Gaunt),
the ruins of which lie on the east side of the town,
near the Porte d'Anvers.</p>

<p>The tradition is that this abbey was founded,
early in the seventh century, by St. Amandus, the
'Apostle of Flanders,' and enlarged, some twenty
years later, by St. Bavon. In the middle of the
ninth century it was almost entirely destroyed by
the Normans, but rose once more at a later period,
only to be demolished by Charles V., who erected
a castle there about the year 1540. A quarter of
a century later, on September 23, 1567, Egmont
and Horn were brought here by the orders of Alva,
and kept in prison until they were carried, 'guarded
by two companies of infantry and one of cavalry,'
to Brussels, where the execution took place, in the
Grande Place, on June 5, 1568.</p>

<p>When the Congress of Ghent assembled in 1576,
the castle was occupied by a Spanish garrison, who
refused to capitulate. It was accordingly besieged
by William of Orange, and 'the deliberations of
the Congress were opened under the incessant roar
of cannon.' The siege ended, by the surrender of the
Spaniards, on the very day on which the sittings of
the Congress were finished by the conclusion of
the treaty known as the 'Pacification,' which was
signed at Ghent on November 9, 1576. </p>

<p>
'The Pacification, as soon as published, was received
with a shout of joy. Proclaimed in the market-place
of every city and village, it was ratified, not by
votes, but by hymns of thanksgiving, by triumphal
music, by thundering of cannon, and by the blaze
of beacons throughout the Netherlands.'<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The
Castle, a monument of the Spanish tyranny, was
pulled down; but many fragments still remain of
the ancient Abbey of St. Bavon.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of the fifteenth century
Hubert van Eyck and his brother Jan were living
at Ghent. Here Hubert began to paint the celebrated
altarpiece, 'The Adoration of the Immaculate
Lamb,' which his brother finished after his
death. This great painting, having survived the
greed of Philip II., the fanaticism of the Puritan
iconoclasts, and the rapacity of the French revolutionary
army, now hangs in the Cathedral of
St. Bavon; and every year hundreds of travellers
visit Ghent in order to see what is, beyond doubt,
the finest production of the Early Flemish School.
In the choir, too, of the Cathedral are four huge
candlesticks of copper, which were originally made
as ornaments for the grave of Henry VIII. at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Windsor, but were sold during the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>In 1500 the infant who afterwards became the
Emperor Charles V. was carried from the Cour des
Princes to the Cathedral. 'His baptism,' we read
in local history, 'was celebrated with right royal
pomp in the Church of St. Bavon. Great rejoicings
signalized the event. The fountains lavishly sent
up streams of purple wine from their fantastic jets,
"mysteries" and mummeries, masks and merry-makings,
usurped for a time the place of commerce
and earnest speculation. The brave and steady
citizens of Ghent ran riot from the house, and never
was Venice herself more wild in the days of her
maddest carnival. We are told that a magic
gallery, 200 feet long, which was maintained during
this temporary jubilee in a state of sufficient
security to insure the safety of the thousands who
thronged it, was erected at a giddy height across
the streets, connecting the tower of the great
Belfry with that of the Church of St. Nicholas.
This was, for three consecutive nights, profusely
illuminated, and threw a brilliant glow over the gay
scene, in which all Ghent was revelling below.'</p>

<p>In the time of Charles V., Ghent was not only
the most powerful city in the rich Netherlands, but one
of the most opulent in all Europe. And what
the Belfry, whose chimes ring out with such sweet
melody by night and day, was to Bruges, that was
to the more warlike men of Ghent the 'iron tongue'
of Roland, the mighty bell which hung in the lofty
watch-tower. It called them to arms. It sent
them forth to battle. It welcomed them home
victorious, or bade them meet and defend their
privileges in the market-place. 'It seemed, as it
were, a living historical personage, endowed with
the human powers and passions which it had so
long directed and inflamed.'</p>

<p>The Belfry of Ghent, black with age, still towers
above the Cloth Hall. But when, in 1540, the
Emperor went there for the purpose of humbling
the town, and punishing the burghers for their
disobedience, he made a decree that Roland, whose
voice had so often given the signal for revolt,
should be taken down. No greater insult could
have been offered to the proud city.</p>

<p>Bruges fell into the decay from which she has
never yet recovered chiefly because, at a time when
the whole commerce of Flanders and Brabant was
beginning to languish, she lost her communications
with the sea; and Ypres was ruined by years of
internal discord and constant war. But Ghent, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
third of the three 'Bonnes Villes' of Flanders,
though the industrial depression which spread over
the Netherlands and the long struggle against Spain
combined to ruin her, has come triumphant through
all vicissitudes. In the old days the men of Ghent
were famous for their turbulent spirit and love of
independence. It was no easy task to rule them,
as Counts of Flanders, or Dukes of Burgundy, or
Kings of Spain often found to their cost. And now
it seems as if the robust character of the burghers
who fought so hard, in mediæval times, to maintain
their liberties, had been merely turned into another
channel, and transmitted to their descendants in the
shape of that keen activity in commerce which
makes this town so prosperous at the present day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>THE DUKES OF BRABANT&mdash;THE JOYEUSE ENTRÉE&mdash;END
OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p><span class="p125">A</span> few miles to the south-west of Alost, on the
borders of East Flanders, the River Dendre, on its
way to join the Scheldt, forms the boundary of
Brabant. From Denderleeuw, the frontier station,
to Brussels is about fifteen miles by train, through
a district which gradually loses the bare flatness of
the plains of Flanders, and becomes wooded, undulating,
and hilly as we approach the city.</p>

<p>And Brussels is quite different from the fallen
towns of Flanders. There are no mouldering
ramparts here, and very few uneven causeways,
but broad boulevards, shaded by trees; handsome
modern houses; wooden pavements in some parts;
a Bourse; arcades and bazaars; tempting shops,
their windows decked with Parisian art; theatres
and music-halls; glittering restaurants and expensive
hotels. It is all modern, spacious, full of
movement. While Bruges and Ypres live chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in the past, Brussels lives chiefly in the present
and the future. But in the middle of the city is
the famous Grande Place; and the tall houses,
so gloriously picturesque with pointed gables and
gilded cornices; and the exquisite Hôtel de Ville
with its curiously carved façade and steep roof
pierced by innumerable little windows, above which
the graceful spire, that 'miracle of needlework in
stone,' has towered for 500 years. Here, as
everywhere in the Netherlands, the traditions of
the past are imperishable; and we may look back
and see how this bright, gay, pleasant city&mdash;the
'petit Paris,' as its people love to call it&mdash;rose and
grew.</p>

<p>Old Brabant extended from beyond Tournai on
the west to what is now the Dutch frontier beyond
Turnhout on the east, and from the neighbourhood
of Ghent nearly to Liége. Just north of the
forest of Soignies a ridge of undulating hills overlooked
the little River Senne, which wound along
eastwards through sandbanks and brushwood. On
an island in this stream, according to tradition, a
chapel was built by St. Gery, Bishop of Cambrai;
a watch-tower, afterwards named the Tower of
St. Nicholas, was erected on a hillock near the
island; wooden houses, with thatched roofs, began
to appear on the banks and here and there on the up which
steep hillside  pathways, afterwards to
become streets, clambered towards a promontory
called the Coudenberg, or Cold Mountain; a market
was established; and the village became known as
Bruxelles, or (at least so it is said) 'the house in
the swamp,' from <i>bruc</i>, swamp, and <i>celle</i>, house.</p>

<h3>BRUSSELS<br /><small><span class="smcap">Place</span> de Brouckére.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_176fp.jpg" alt="BRUSSELS&mdash;Place de Brouckére." width="600" height="432" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></div>

<p>From a long time, in the early tales about
Brabant, there are the usual legends of warriors
and saints; but when we reach the period of
authentic history there are four chief towns,
Louvain, Brussels, Antwerp, and Bois-le-Duc. Of
these the most important was Louvain. In 1190
the Counts of Louvain became Dukes of Brabant.
They built a castle on the Coudenberg, and for the
next 300 years the Court of Brabant was celebrated
for its power and splendour.</p>

<p>Lying in the midst of a fertile district, and on
the trade-route from Flanders to Germany, Brussels
was a convenient stopping-place for travellers. But
in the Middle Ages, when Bruges, Ghent, Ypres,
and other places were so prosperous, the history of
Brussels is less eventful; and it was only when the
famous Flemish cities were about to fall that the
town on the Senne became an important centre of
industry. Its population, too, increased rapidly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
owing to the numbers of workmen who came from
Louvain in consequence of commercial troubles
there.</p>

<p>So trade flourished, and Brussels grew rich; but
the continual wars which desolated France, the chief
market for the manufactures of the Netherlands,
did harm to the linen trade, which suffered also
from the keen competition of English merchants.
The raw material came from England, and by prohibiting
the exportation of wool England was able
to wellnigh ruin this branch of the trade of
Flanders and Brabant. Fortunately, however, for
Brussels, the introduction of new industries at this
critical time made the damage to the linen trade
less fatal, and with the growth of flax-weaving, the
art of tapestry-making, dye-works, and the production
of valuable armour, the town more than held
its own.</p>

<p>Luxury and display followed, as usual, in the
train of wealth, and Brussels became a city of
pleasure, of fêtes, and gorgeous festivals. The
Court of Brabant was one of the most luxurious
and dissolute in Europe. The Dukes set an
example of extravagance which was followed by
the Barons who surrounded them, and also by the
rich bourgeois. 'The people alone,' we are told,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
'that is to say, the men without leisure, the
artisans, remained apart from excesses.' There
was luxury in dress, in armour, in furniture. The
rich went about clad in gold brocades and other
costly stuffs, attended by servants in fine liveries.
Their horses were richly caparisoned, and their
wives and daughters spent large sums on magnificent
robes, and decked themselves with jewels,
and garlands from the rose-gardens for which
Brussels was already famous.</p>

<p>Every occasion for a fête was eagerly welcomed.
Not only was there the yearly 'Ommegang,' that
time-honoured procession through the streets of
triumphal cars, bands of music, and giants, which
delighted the people of Brabant and Flanders, but
each separate guild and confraternity had its own
festival. In private life every event&mdash;a birth, a
baptism, a marriage, or a death&mdash;was an excuse for
spending money on display. To such an extent,
indeed, was this carried, that rules were made forbidding
invitations being sent except to near
relatives, to prevent people going to fêtes without
being asked, and at length even to put some limit
on the value of the presents which it was customary
to give to guests. The licentious and wasteful
habits of the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> became so notorious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
that there was a lock-up at each of the city gates
for the benefit of young men who were living too
fast. In such a state of society the money-lender
saw his chance; but a law was passed making it
illegal for anyone to sign a promissory note, or
anticipate his inheritance, before reaching the age
of twenty-eight. Brussels was full of taverns, and
there were parts of the town where every house
was occupied by women of easy virtue. Fortunes
were recklessly squandered, and most of the nobles
are said to have been insolvent, and to have left
heavy debts behind them.</p>

<p>Not a vestige remains of the wall which surrounded
this mediæval Brussels except the Porte
de Hal, at the corner where the modern Boulevard
de Waterloo meets the Boulevard du Midi; and
the Hôtel de Ville and the guild-houses in the
Grande Place have undergone many changes since
the fourteenth century. A great part of the
Church of Ste. Gudule, however&mdash;the choir and
transept, part of the nave, and the south aisle&mdash;was
built in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries;
and during that period Notre Dame de la Chapelle
and Notre Dame du Sablon rose on the foundations
of more ancient churches. The houses, even
of the rich, were still of wood, with sometimes a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
tower of stone, built irregularly on the hillside
which rose from the valley of the Senne, each house
standing by itself, with its thatched roof, from
which in winter the rain or melted snow poured
(there were, of course, no gutters then), and found
its way down to the lower ground, which was thus
little better than a swamp, even long after Brussels
had become an important city. It was in the
midst of this mixture of discomfort and luxury, so
characteristic of the Middle Ages, that the people
of Brussels, and of Brabant generally, passed their
lives&mdash;gay, joyous, dissolute, but always with an
eye to the main chance, and growing richer and
richer. And in one thing Brabant differed greatly
from Flanders. While in Flanders the towns were
generally at deadly feud with each other&mdash;Bruges
fighting with Ghent, and Ghent at enmity with
Ypres, with each town divided into hostile factions,
such as the Leliarts and Clauwerts, within its own
walls, the people of Brabant seem to have lived at
peace with each other, and, as a rule, to have made
it their first business always to combine for the
defence of their common interests. And in the
middle of the fourteenth century came a time
which called for mutual reliance.</p>

<p>The last Duke of Brabant in the male line of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
House of Louvain was Jean III. He died in 1355,
leaving no heir male; and thus the succession fell
to his daughter Jeanne,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> who had married Wencelas, brother of Charles IV. of Luxembourg.</p>

<p>From time immemorial the rulers of Brabant, on
succeeding to the throne, had taken an oath to
maintain the liberty of their subjects; and many
charters confirming ancient rights and privileges
had been drawn up for the towns and communes.
Before recognising the Duchess Jeanne and her
husband, the towns of Brabant addressed to them
a series of demands, which they requested the new
rulers to accept. These took the form of a charter
enumerating and confirming all the points which
constituted public liberty in Brabant; and this
charter received the name of the Joyeuse Entrée
(or Blyde Incompste), because it was hailed with
such applause by the representatives of the people.
The inauguration of the Duchess Jeanne and
Wencelas took place at Louvain on January 3,
1356, when they swore to maintain all the ancient
privileges of the country. Thereafter the act of
inauguration of each ruler of Brabant was known
as his Joyeuse Entrée, and each Joyeuse Entrée
was a development of acts declaring public rights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
which had previously existed, just as Magna Charta
was founded on the older liberties of England.
Each Duke had his Joyeuse Entrée, which he
accepted sometimes with as little goodwill as King
John felt at Runnymede. Thus, this famous
constitution, the best known and the most
liberal of all the free charters in the Netherlands,
was not a parchment drawn up at one time, but
a declaration of public rights which gradually
developed.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>'The inauguration of a Duke of Brabant was a
splendid and imposing ceremony. The Prince,
who was lord of the noble Duchy, went to make
himself known to his subjects, and to confirm the
relations which secured both his and their happiness.
He arrived, with his courtiers, at the ancient
capital of Brabant, Louvain. As he descended the
Brussels road he saw from afar the cradle of his
ancestors, with its steeples, towers, and majestic
walls, in the rich valley of the Dyle. Before entering,
the heir of the old Counts of Louvain stopped
for a little at the gates of the city, in the Monastery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of Terbanck, where, in the midst of an immense
crowd, the clergy, the officers of the University, and
the magistrates, came to greet him. The brilliant
assemblage then went into the chapel, where the
Abbess of Terbanck, at the altar, took the crucifix
and gave it to the highest dignitary of the Church
who was present, and he, approaching the Duke,
gave it him to kiss. The Rector of the University
made an oration in the name of the University and
the clergy. The Mayor placed in the Duke's
hands the red staff of justice, emblem of his office.
The Burgomaster gave him the keys of the city;
and the Pensionary of Louvain welcomed him on
behalf of all the local magistrates. Then the procession,
to the sound of trumpets, went forth on
horseback through the gates, the Duke and his
Councillors, the States of Brabant, and the magistrates
of Louvain, to the Church of St. Pierre,
where they all dismounted and entered the choir;
and there, after prayers had been said, the Prince
swore to maintain the liberties and privileges of
the Church in Brabant. Thence they went to the
market-place, which was between the church and
the Hôtel de Ville. The Duke took his stand on
a platform with the representatives of the people
of Brabant, and the Chancellor announced that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
was about to swear his Joyeuse Entrée. The Act
of Inauguration was read, first in Flemish and
then in French, and the Duke repeated it word
for word, and took an oath to the barons, nobles,
towns, and franchises of the Duchy, that he would
be their good and loyal seigneur, and that he
would not treat them otherwise than justly, and
in accordance with all their rights. They clothed
the Duke in a robe of crimson trimmed with
ermine, and put the ducal coronet of Brabant upon
his head. The States swore fidelity to him. The
trumpets sounded. The air was filled with acclamations;
and the heralds' voices crying, "Long live
the Duke of Brabant!" told the Duchy that another
ruler had taken possession of his heritage in accordance
with ancient custom.'<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p>The 'States' of Brabant grew out of the primitive
method of government by an assembly of the
people in the market-place, where each vassal
voted in person. Later, chosen representatives
alone voted; and at the end of the fourteenth
century the clergy began to attend as a separate
order in the assembly. The name of 'États' was
not used in Brabant till 1421, when the nobles,
clergy, and commons called themselves the States
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of Brabant.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Side by side with the States grew
up the Council of Brabant, which was originally a
consulting body, a judicial council to assist the
Duke in administering the law, but which gradually
came to concern itself with the management of
local affairs, while the States conducted the public
business of the duchy.</p>

<p>Soon after the inauguration of Jeanne and
Wencelas, the jealous and ambitious Louis of
Maele, Count of Flanders, who had married
Jeanne's sister Marguerite, made war upon
Brabant, and the struggle continued for years.
Wencelas, whom Froissart describes as a wise and
gallant man, was at last quite worn out by the
troubles which beset him. He spent the winter
and summer of 1382-1383 at Brussels with his wife,
and tried to forget his sorrows in hunting, and in a
round of balls and tournaments. But his health
was ruined, and, having gone to breathe his native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
air in Luxembourg, he died there on December
3, 1383.</p>

<p>The Duchess Jeanne, who survived her husband
for thirteen years, years of constant trouble, died
on December 1, 1406, at the age of eighty, after
a reign of fifty years, and was buried in the old
church of the Carmelites at Brussels. On her
death the duchy of Brabant passed, by a family
arrangement, to the House of Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Under the House of Burgundy, during the fifteenth
century Brussels became more than ever
a city of pomp, gaiety, and pleasure. For nearly
half a century of this period the history of Brabant
is full of the names of Philip the Good and Charles
the Bold. Philip lived generally at Brussels, and
this brought to the town so many Frenchmen that
French became the language of the Court and the
fashionable tongue amongst the noblesse. The old
castle or palace of the Dukes of Brabant on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Coudenberg was enlarged, and beautified by the
addition of the Great Hall, where the Knights of the
Golden Fleece, whose Order Philip founded, used
to hold their Chapters, and which in later days was
to witness the imposing spectacle of the abdication
of Charles V. The boundaries of the park were
extended, walls were built round it, and it was
stocked with game. Bishops and nobles built
themselves great mansions. The first stone of the
magnificent Hôtel de Ville had been carved at the
beginning of the century, and in 1444 Charles the
Bold, then only ten years old, laid the foundations
of the lofty spire, on the summit of which ten
years later was placed that gilded statue of
St. Michael which is there to this day. The
Burgundian Library still remains, with its wealth
of illuminated manuscripts and rare books; and
the paintings of Roger van der Weyden and his
cotemporaries show how art flourished at Brussels
in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Unlike Philip, Charles the Bold detested the
people of Brussels. His father, he said, had
increased their riches and their pride beyond
measure. He attacked the States of Brabant, and
threatened to pull down the walls and gates of
Brussels.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></div>

<p> And when, after sweeping like a tempest over Europe,
he died before the walls of Nancy in 1477,
and the male line of the House of Burgundy
came to an end, it was seen that the wide domain
over which his family had reigned so proudly, and
which he left to his daughter Marie, was torn
by internal dissensions, and that the people of
Brabant and Flanders were smarting under the
inroads which had been made upon their ancient
privileges.</p>

<h3>BRUSSELS<br /><small><span class="smcap">Entrance</span> to the old church of the Carmelites.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_188fp.jpg" alt="BRUSSELS&mdash;Entrance to the old church of the Carmelites." width="442" height="600" /></div>

<p>The Duchess Marie succeeded to a splendid
inheritance, but her position was full of difficulty.
Her treasury was empty. She had no army at
her command. Popular discontent was growing.
Her father had made the haughty burghers of
Ghent bow before him, but as soon as he was dead
they rose again. Ghent, Bruges, Brussels, all
Brabant, were seething with disaffection. Payment
of the taxes was refused and the officers
of the Government were ill-treated. And, moreover,
Hannibal was at the gates, in the person
of Louis XI., who had rejoiced on hearing of
the fate of Charles the Bold. The inauguration
of Marie took place at the end of May, 1477,
five months after her father's death; and her
Joyeuse Entrée not only renewed the public
rights which Philip and Charles had infringed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
but placed fresh restrictions on the power of the
future rulers of Brabant.</p>

<p>The marriage of the young Duchess to some
husband who could defend her rights was seen
to be the only means of preserving the peace of
the country. Her distrust of Louis XI. led her to
refuse an alliance with a French Prince. She
chose the Archduke Maximilian of Austria, and
thus the fortunes of Brabant and Flanders were
united with the fortunes of the House of Hapsburg,
and the opportunity of peacefully absorbing
Belgium was lost to France.</p>

<p>The marriage was celebrated in August, 1477.
Five years later Marie died, leaving a son&mdash;the boy,
then four years of age, who was afterwards known
as Philip the Fair. He in turn married Joanna,
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain; and
the offspring of this marriage was the Great
Emperor Charles V., during whose reign the
capital of Brabant was more brilliant than ever.</p>

<p>No story is better known than the story of how
in the evil days, when Philip II. ruled the 'Spanish
Netherlands' in the interests of the Church, Bréderode
and his friends, hearing of Berlaimont's scornful
words, assumed the name of 'Beggars,' by
which their party was afterwards known. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
how typical it is! How full their doings are of
the gay spirit of Brabant! It is springtime,
fresh and bright, when the confederate nobles leave
the mansion of Count Kuilemburg,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> a brilliant
company of handsome, hot-blooded men of fashion
and high birth, bearded all, and dressed in the
elaborate finery of that time, and walk to the
palace, where Margaret of Parma awaits them.
They pass along the roadway which crowns the
ridge, overlooking the multitude of pointed roofs
below them to the left, with the spire of the Hôtel
de Ville rising from where an opening among the
housetops marks the situation of the Grande Place,
where so many of them are afterwards to lay down
their lives. The majestic towers of Ste. Gudule stand
out above the houses which cluster round them
on the plateau of St. Michael. In front of them
is the palace, and beyond it the green glades and
pleasure-grounds of the park. A crowd of people,
who have climbed up from the lower town by the
long steep way known as La Chausée and the
Montagne de la Cour, greet them with cheers at
the entrance of the palace. The doors of that
magnificent dwelling receive the glittering band,
who go with gay insouciance to their momentous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
interview, and come out from it in the same spirit.
They walk about the streets, and pass Berlaimont,
who is talking to Arenberg. 'Look at our fine
beggars!' says Berlaimont. 'How they ruffle it
before us!' They sup at Kuilemburg's. Bréderode
repeats Berlaimont's jest against them. They take
it up. They toast 'The Beggars.' They dress
themselves up as beggars, with leathern wallets
and wooden bowls. They laugh, and spill their
wine about, drain more bumpers to the Beggars'
health, dance on the tables, and shout 'Vivent les
Gueux!'<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Not even the grave face of Orange,
who comes in, can stop the revel. And next day
they lay aside their fine clothes, dress themselves,
their families, and their servants as beggars, shave
off their beards, and go about with wallets and
bowls.</p>

<p>This was the spirit of the masquerade, of the
carnival, the Kermesse; and thirty years later,
when for a whole generation the country had
suffered unexampled miseries, and most of the
beggars of 1566 had perished by a violent death,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193-194]</a></span>
the arrival of the Archduke Ernest as Governor of
Brabant was made the occasion for a grotesque display&mdash;'a stately procession of knights and burghers
in historical and mythological costumes, followed
by ships, dromedaries, elephants, whales, giants,
dragons.' A strange people. The Dutch had
fought with all the courage of the Nervii, and
gained their freedom. The Belgians, descendants
of the Nervii, had been slaughtered, defeated,
tortured, and made slaves, had seen their country
laid waste, and their cherished liberties taken from
them wholesale; and yet, when all was lost and the
heel of the oppressor was planted firmly on their
necks, they were made happy by a circus procession.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>THE BOMBARDMENT OF 1695&mdash;THE GRANDE PLACE&mdash;CHURCH
OF STE. GUDULE&mdash;CHARLES OF LORRAINE</small></h2>


<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> sixteenth century closes with the cession by
Philip II. of the Spanish Netherlands to his
daughter Isabella, as a dowry on her marriage to
the Archduke Albert of Austria. The King died
on September 13, 1598, and a year later the
Infanta and her husband entered Brabant. When
they rode through Brussels in the state procession,
the Infanta's saddle was studded with diamonds
and rubies to the value of 200,000 florins. The
magistrates presented them with a magnificent
service of silver plate. There were fêtes, fireworks,
and illuminations, which lasted for three days.
On a medal struck to commemorate this occasion,
we see them seated in a triumphal chair, surrounded
by sunbeams, and with olive branches in their
hands. The condition of the country was deplorable,
but the evils of the time seemed all forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in the midst of a round of festivities. The private
virtues of Isabella and her husband made them
popular, but, needless to say, Belgium was the
battle-field of Europe during most of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>These almost incessant wars culminated, so far
as Brussels was concerned, in the bombardment of
August, 1695. For twenty years the city had
been menaced with destruction. It is said that
Antoinette Bourignon, a noted adventuress and
soothsayer, who died in 1681, had foretold that the
capital of Brabant would perish by fire, and this
was remembered when, in the summer of 1695,
Villeroi, failing to relieve Namur, which William III.
was then besieging, marched on Brussels with an
army 70,000 strong.</p>

<p>In the first week of August it became known
that an immense store of bombs had been prepared
at Mons, and that Villeroi was at Enghien. The
French left that place on the 10th, and next
day encamped at Anderlecht, close to Brussels.
Preparations were made for defence. The Guilds
furnished men; the avenues between the Porte de
Namur and the Porte de Hal were fortified; and
the low-lying grounds were inundated. But the
French came nearer; and on the 13th Villeroi sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
in a message saying that the Most Christian King
had ordered him to bombard the town in retaliation
for the way in which the English and Dutch fleets
had treated the seaports of France; that, as
vengeance was repugnant to the goodness of his
master, he had been commanded to say that if the
allies would in future refrain from such modes of
warfare, he would do the same by them, and retire
from before the city if, within six hours, he received
a definite answer of such a nature that he could
accept it.</p>

<p>On receiving this ultimatum, the magistrates
asked for time to communicate with the Elector
and the King of England. An hour and a half
was granted, but as no answer had been sent when
that time expired, some bombs were thrown, and
one man was killed on the Montagne de la Cour.
Presently a message arrived from the Elector
asking for a delay of twenty-four hours, so that he
might send for the opinion of King William.
Villeroi's reply was to commence the bombardment
at once, and forthwith bomb-shells and red-hot shot
came pouring on the town.</p>

<p>The cannonade began at seven in the evening,
and continued all night and during part of next
morning. The whole city was in wild confusion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the people flying for refuge, as their dwellings took
fire. There was a strong wind blowing from the
west, and the flames spread from one house to
another along the narrow streets, especially in the
centre of the town, which was soon blazing like a
vast furnace. It is said that nearly 4,000 houses
were burned to the ground, and many damaged
beyond repair. In the Grande Place, the Hôtel
de Ville, the Brodhuis, and other old buildings
were almost totally destroyed. The Church of
St. Nicholas, the tower of which was the belfry of
Brussels, sank in ruins. Many sick persons
perished in burning hospitals. Convents and
churches were shattered, and their ornaments,
paintings, and archives disappeared. The old
church of the Carmelites was entirely destroyed,
and of the tomb of Jeanne, the last Duchess of
Brabant, who was buried in the choir, not a trace
remained. When the work of destruction was
finished, and the French retired, it was seen that a
great part of the city was lying in ruins.</p>

<p>Before the bombardment, the Hôtel de Ville
was nearly in its original condition; but now the
west side was demolished by the bomb-shells, the
roof had been consumed by the flames, and the
whole building, with the exception of the spire and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the west front, was almost entirely destroyed. So
that the Hôtel de Ville of Brussels, as we see it
now, is, except the spire and the façade towards
the Grande Place, much changed from what it was
previously to 1695.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> So are the guild-houses&mdash;l'Étoile,
the first house next to the Hôtel de Ville,
looking from the Grande Place, in the fourteenth
century the headquarters of the Amman, or head
of the trades, and once a tavern surrounded by a
garden; Le Cygne, next to l'Étoile, which had
been rebuilt in 1523 with a façade of wood; the
Maison des Brasseurs, in the seventeenth century
the guild-house of the brewers, and now a café,
surmounted by a modern statue of Charles of
Lorraine. These houses, and many more, suffered
from the French shot, and had to be practically
rebuilt.</p>

<p>The most interesting building in the Grande
Place, with the exception of the Hôtel de Ville, is
that in the north-east corner, opposite the Hôtel
de Ville. It is now called the 'Maison du Roi,'
but is known to history as the 'Brodhuis,' because
a list of the current prices for bread used to be put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
up there, when it was a <i>dépendance</i> of the Hôtel
de Ville. It was so much damaged by the bombardment
that it had to be entirely pulled down,
but was rebuilt exactly on the original place in
every detail. It was in the original Brodhuis that
Egmont and Horn were imprisoned, and led forth
to execution in the Grande Place on June 5, 1568.
The large chamber on the third story, now the
Communal Museum, is on the site of the room in
which Egmont passed his last night, and is exactly
the same, except that the present roof is higher. So
well was the restoration of this beautiful building
done, that no great effort of imagination is needed
to picture the last scenes of that dismal tragedy.</p>

<h3>BRUSSELS<br /><small><span class="smcap">The</span> Cathedral of Ste. Gudule.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_200fp.jpg" alt="BRUSSELS&mdash;The Cathedral of Ste. Gudule." width="456" height="600" /></div>

<p>Nothing remains of the first Church of Ste. Gudule,
which is said to have stood on the spot now occupied
by the nave, and to have been erected there early
in the eleventh century, on the site of a still older
church. The present building dates from the
thirteenth century. It suffered at the hands of
the Reformers during the religious troubles of the
sixteenth century, having been sacked and pillaged
on June 6, 1579. The clergy had the foresight to
carry away most of their treasures before the storm
burst; but many tombs and monuments were
ruthlessly destroyed. </p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></div>

<p>The vault of the Dukes of Brabant was violated; but in 1585, after the
return of the Spaniards, the remains which had been torn from their coffins and scattered about
were collected and placed in a large wooden chest.
In May, 1834, when the vault was opened for the
burial of the Prince Royal, son of Leopold I., and
brother of the present King of the Belgians, a
number of bones were found lying on the ground&mdash;the
bones of the Dukes and Princes of the lordly
House of Brabant, the chest which contained them
having mouldered away.</p>

<p>During the French occupation, Ste. Gudule,
which had passed uninjured through Villeroi's
bombardment, was closed for two years, from 1798
to 1800, and there was a proposal to pull it down
to make way for a theatre.</p>

<p>By that time, however, Brussels had several
theatres; and of these the best known was the
Théâtre de la Monnaie. Until the works of the
great French dramatists were introduced, the only
spectacles of the nature of stage-plays known in
Brussels were long, dull pieces in the form
generally of mystery plays. For instance, in the
sixteenth century they acted, at the Convent of
the Carmelites, the 'Tragedy of the Passion.' In
this piece, which was in three acts, there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
chorus of children dressed as angels. News was
brought to the wife of Malchus that St. Peter had
cut off her husband's ear, on which the angels
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">À Malchus l'oreille</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Le Seigneur lui dit,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Turelututu renguaine, renguaine ton coutiau,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Dans son fouriau.'</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was a great change from monkish doggerel
like this to the French dramas, which, after being
first played privately at the houses of some of the
nobility, soon reached the general public, and
created the demand for a theatre. In 1698 the
old Mint House, which stood in the Place de la
Monnaie, at that time a narrow thoroughfare
blocked up by wooden buildings, was bought by
an architect, Jean Paul Bombarda. He obtained
leave to erect a 'Hôtel des Spectacles,' and was
granted a monopoly of playing operas and comedies,
and giving balls, for thirty years from January,
1705. But one manager after another failed, and
it seemed as if the theatre must close its doors,
when the actors themselves formed in 1766 a
company on the model of the Comédie Française,
which afterwards received a subsidy from the city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
From that time the fortunes of the Théâtre de la
Monnaie, now so well known, began to mend.
The present building dates from 1817.</p>

<p>It was during the peaceable reign of Maria
Theresa&mdash;peaceable, at least, so far as the soil of
Belgium was concerned&mdash;that the theatre became
so popular in Brussels. Brabant was then free
from the troubles which had so often interfered
with progress in more important things than the
stage; and the people of the capital were kept in
good-humour by the popularity of Duke Charles
of Lorraine, who became Governor of the Austrian
Netherlands in 1741.</p>

<p>In March, 1744, he came to live permanently in
Brussels, accompanied by his wife, the Archduchess
Marie, sister of Maria Theresa. They entered by
the Allée Verte, then and for a long time after the
fashionable promenade of Brussels. A battalion
of the English Horse Guards was drawn up on
the meadows at the side of the avenue. The Duke
reviewed these troops; and then the cavalcade
started along that green way from the Palace of
Laeken, which so many joyful bands have trodden.
The Horse Guards led the procession. Then came
Charles of Lorraine in a carriage, followed by
Ministers of State, and the lords and gentlemen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the Court, attended by some squadrons of English
cavalry. At the Porte de Laeken, the burgomaster,
kneeling reverently, presented the keys
of the city in a silver basin. Thence they went
through the streets to the Hôtel de Ville, and
up the Rue de la Montagne to the Church of
Ste. Gudule, where they were received by the
Cardinal Archbishop of Malines and his clergy,
who said mass. In the evening every street and
square in Brussels blazed with illuminations.</p>

<p>That day was the beginning of a long period of
gaiety for the pleasure-loving city. No ruler could
have suited the people of Brussels better than
Charles of Lorraine. The annals of his time are
full of merrymaking, the accounts of which enable
us, perhaps better than graver histories do, to
understand the Court of the Austrian Netherlands
in the long reign of Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>In February, 1752, we find the Duke giving
a 'Venetian Fête' in the palace of the Duc d'Arenberg,
at which all the gay people in Brussels were
present. There were four quadrilles, the first
consisting of eight ladies and gentlemen dressed
as gardeners, the second of pilgrims, the third
and fourth of peasants and sailors. A masked
supper followed the dancing, and at midnight all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the company, still in their masks, drove in open
carriages through the streets. The coachmen were
masked, as were the grooms who rode beside each
carriage with torches, and so were the musicians
who played before and after them on their way to
the Théâtre de la Monnaie, where they danced and
feasted and gambled till morning.</p>

<p>Charles of Lorraine lived generally at the
château of Tervueren, where he spent large sums
on stocking the woods and lakes with game and
fish. 'What I must put in my park at Tervueren,'
he notes in his private diary&mdash;'8 roe bucks, 150
hares, 100 pheasants, 4 wood cocks, 6 grey hens,
10 Guinea fowls, 50 partridges, 20 red partridges,
100 wild ducks. Of fish&mdash;600 tortoises, 300 crabs,
200 trout, 100 sturgeons.'</p>

<p>Every day he jotted down in his diary all his
doings, all his petty cash payments, what the
members of his Court did, and even the names
of their mistresses. The Duc d'Arenberg gives
jewels to La Nogentelle, a danseuse at the
Monnaie. The Dutch Minister is ruining himself
for La Cintray, another dancer; and the English
Minister has lost his head over Mademoiselle
Durancy. The Prince de Ligne and M. Androuins
spent much time and money in company with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
sisters Eugénie and Angélique d'Hannetaire.
M. d'Hannetaire, the father of these young women,
had begun life as a comedian in Brussels, and was
now manager of the Monnaie. He had three
daughters, who went in the <i>demi-monde</i> by the
name of the Three Graces, and used their father's
house as a place of assignation for gentlemen of
quality. D'Hannetaire is said to have been luckier
than most managers, and to have made a large
fortune, much of it by the faro-table in the foyer of
his theatre, where at that time heavy gambling went
on every night.</p>

<p>Duke Charles was a great gourmet, and gave
famous dinners, and, of course, makes a note of
the wines. Burgundy was evidently his own
favourite tipple. He drank at least a bottle at
every meal; but there was Rhine wine, Champagne,
Bordeaux, and Tokay for his guests, not to speak
of cognac, maraschino, and other liqueurs, all of
the very best. He had red partridges sent from
the Tyrol; and his cash-book records '114 livres
paid to an express from Venice with a barrel of
tunny-fish in oil, and for another express from
Hamburg with a barrel of English oysters and
black mussels.' In the official calendar of this jovial
Prince the names of all who worked in his kitchen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
are given, from the head chef down to the turnspits.
The name of the Chef Rôtisseur, curiously enough,
was Rognon. The Comte de Sart held the important
office of Grand Maître des Cuisines.</p>

<p>He was the darling of Brussels, and so much
loved that in the year 1766, when he was very ill,
the churches were never empty all day long, so
many pious people went to pray for his recovery.
When his health was restored there were all sorts
of festivities: the fountains spouted wine; half
the town got drunk; the Prince de Ligne had
an ox roasted whole on the street in front of his
mansion and given to the poor; and the first time
the Duke appeared at the theatre there was so
much applause that the performance was stopped,
and his doctor, who was seen in a box, was cheered
again and again for having cured his patient.</p>

<p>Three years later, on the twenty-fifth anniversary
of his coming to Brabant, there were fêtes
which continued for days. The Hôtel de Ville,
the Brodhuis, and all the Grande Place glittered
with coloured lights. The Comte de Sart illuminated
his house with 1,000 red and yellow
lanterns. There was a great banquet in the Hôtel
de Ville, where 1,400 guests, the ladies seated and
the gentlemen standing, were waited on by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
200 grenadiers, and a free performance at the
theatre, where two glasses of punch were given
to each spectator. Medals were struck to commemorate
the event. The town of Brussels presented
the Duke with 25,000 florins, and the States
of Brabant voted him a statue and 40,000 florins.</p>

<p>There never was a Prince so popular or so
respected in Brussels before or after him, and he
had thirty-six long years of it. But the revels
came to an end in July, 1780, when he died at his
château at Tervueren, and was buried in the Church
of Ste. Gudule, in the vault of Albert and Isabella.</p>

<p>Five months later the news reached Brussels
that the Empress Maria Theresa had died at
Vienna; and on the evening of December 23 a
funeral service was held in Ste. Gudule. Mass
being ended, the heralds, standing at the high
altar, proclaimed the titles of the late Empress.
Then one of them said in solemn tones: 'She
is dead; may God have mercy on her soul.' And
as the clergy intoned the <i>De Profundis</i>, sobs were
heard in every corner of the dark, vast building,
amidst which Toison d'Or, King-at-Arms, took
up the sword of State, and, holding it high above
his head, cried with a loud voice: 'Long live
Joseph the Second, our Sovereign!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<small>JOSEPH II. AND THE REVOLUTION OF BRABANT</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was difficult to follow an Empress like Maria
Theresa, or to find a successor to Charles of
Lorraine in the government of the Austrian
Netherlands. But if ever a Sovereign came to a
throne full of good intentions it was Joseph II.;
and yet, while the easy-going Charles had pleased
the people of Brussels for thirty-six years, the
reforming Joseph had in less than ten caused the
Revolution of Brabant.</p>

<p>It was evident that many reforms were urgent.
For a long time the spirit at least of the constitution
of Brabant had suffered from the encroachment
of the Imperial Government, and the country
was losing its moral fibre. Nor had the peaceful
and happy times of the Empress Maria Theresa
rescued the people from the utter demoralization
which long wars and their own submission to Spain
had brought about. Every sphere of social life
and every department of the Government required
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to be overhauled and invigorated. Moreover, the
Austrian Netherlands were as Catholic as ever.
The new light of the eighteenth century had not
reached the clergy, who were still groping about
in mediæval darkness; and some fresh system of
educating the priesthood was clearly needed.
Joseph II. might thus have found his task comparatively
easy if he had gone about it in the right
way, and taken counsel with the representatives of
the people before introducing the reforms on which
he was bent. Unfortunately he took a different
line, asserted his personal authority, and tried to
play the double rôle of an autocrat and a reformer,
with disastrous results.</p>

<p>The Church was speedily offended, for in
November, 1782, the Emperor issued an edict
granting civil liberty to the Protestants, and
allowing them to build churches, to enjoy the
privileges of citizenship, to take University degrees,
and hold public offices. The Bishops protested
against all this, but they were not listened to; and
another edict allowed Protestants to open schools
in any place where there were a hundred families
of their religion, and to bury their dead according
to their own rites. These measures of toleration
were followed by a decree compelling the religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
associations to register all their property in a new
office, called the Caisse de Religion. The appeal
to the Pope was abolished; and the settlement of
disputes connected with marriages was taken from
the Bishops, who saw their judgments submitted
to the approval or disapproval of the civil powers.
Convents were suppressed and turned into barracks
or hospitals. The Emperor did his best to alter
the Catholic liturgy. He drew up a philosophical
catechism of his own invention. He ordered the
use of new vestments. Marriage was to be regarded
as a civil contract, and divorce was to be allowed.</p>

<p>The most fervent adherents of the Church
acknowledged that new schools for the training of
young priests were needed; but the Emperor tried
to set up a system of his own in defiance of the
views of the clergy. The chief bone of contention
on this point was the establishment of the
Séminaire Générale for the education of youths
who were intended for the priesthood. The
University of Louvain, the old capital of Brabant,
had been one of the most celebrated seats of learning
in Europe; and there the new seminary was
planted by an edict of October, 1786, which
declared that the existing episcopal schools were
to be abolished, and the clergy of the future to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
educated at the seminary of Louvain. The purpose
of the Emperor, it was announced in an official
proclamation, was to bring back the clergy of the
Netherlands to 'primitive Christianity,' and to
substitute for the monkish system of education
'enthusiasm for their native land and attachment
to the Austrian Monarchy,' to destroy the 'Ultramontane
Hydra,' to teach them science and
philosophy, art and letters, and reveal to them
the lessons and the benefits of modern thought and
progress; in a word, to make them useful citizens
and give them a liberal education. But the Church
would have none of these things, and in the Catholic
Netherlands the influence of the Church was overwhelming.</p>

<p>At Brussels, certainly, the people were not
greatly moved by these attacks on the privileges
of the clergy, nor disturbed at the prospect of
having a cultured priesthood, and only began to
grumble when an attempt was made to interfere
with the Kermesses and national fêtes, in which
they so much delighted; but the Emperor went
on to irritate the States and Council of Brabant,
which the citizens revered as the guardians of their
liberty, and from that moment his enterprise was
doomed to failure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
The States declared that the Church reforms
were illegal; but the Emperor ignored their
opinion. The Council declared that its privileges
were invaded by the establishment of a new Court
of Appeal at Brussels. And both the States and
the Council protested against other changes in the
system of government on which the Emperor had
set his heart. The Council continued to sit in
defiance of his wishes; and the States met, and
refused to vote supplies until their grievances were
redressed. The Joyeuse Entrée had been infringed,
they said; and soon, not only in Brabant, but in
every part of Belgium, people were talking about
their rights.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Brabant would not have been Brabant if some
comedy had not been acted on the political stage
at such a time. 'It was at this juncture,' we read,
'that there appeared upon the scene a woman who
played a great rôle in the Revolution. The Dame
de Bellem, called La Pinaud, after having been a
lady of fashion at Brussels, began to mix herself
up in political discussions with all the impetuosity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of an ardent and passionate heart. Her intimate
relations with the advocate Van der Noot much
contributed, no doubt, to lead her into this path,
where she was followed by her daughter Marianne,
the Muse of this period with little poetry. Both
of them helped the enemies of Austria with their
pens and their influence over the numerous young
men who attended their soirées; and the smiles of
these two ladies, who are said to have been very
pretty, doubtless gained more partisans to the
Revolutionary cause than the pamphlets of the
mother or the verses of the daughter.'<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Henri Nicolas Van der Noot, advocate and
standing counsel for the trades before the Council
of Brabant, and lover of the Dame de Bellem, was
made President of a Revolutionary Committee at
Brussels, and put his eloquence, which was that of
a mob orator, at the service of the Bishops, who
came forward as the defenders of the Constitution.
In vain Joseph II. protested that he had no wish
to infringe the Joyeuse Entrée. Van der Noot
thundered, La Pinaud wrote, her daughter canvassed,
the Bishops preached against him. A
service was held in Ste. Gudule to invoke the aid of
Heaven against the Séminaire Générale and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
new ways, and on behalf of the Joyeuse Entrée.
On leaving the church, some young people put on
tricolor cockades, and this badge was soon common
in the streets. Things went from bad to worse,
and on May 18, 1789, Brussels was on the brink of
revolution.</p>

<p>An immense crowd filled the Grande Place,
where the States were sitting in the Hôtel de Ville
to consider an ultimatum which had come from
Vienna, demanding supplies and the suppression of
the Council of Brabant. The States refused the
supplies, and directed the Council to sit <i>en permanence</i>.
The Emperor's Minister, Count Trauttmansdorff,
by turns implored and threatened.
'Your resistance,' he told them, 'will ruin you.'
'The Emperor,' they replied, 'may destroy us, but
he cannot coerce our consciences or our honour.'
Troops were then marched into the Grande Place.
A squadron of dragoons were drawn up between
the Brodhuis and the Hôtel de Ville, and the
States were informed that the Joyeuse Entrée of
Brabant was suppressed. On this the Marquis de
Prud'homme d'Aillay rose, and said to the Minister:
'Since there is nothing more for us to do here, I am,
sir, your very humble servant,' and left the Hôtel
de Ville, followed by all the members of the States.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>The news from Paris, where the clouds were
gathering dark round the head of his sister Marie
Antoinette, might have made Joseph II. pause;
but, far away in Vienna, he made up his mind to
go on as he had begun. So the Revolution of
Brabant gained force, and Van der Noot was the
popular idol, with all Brussels at his feet. On his
return from a tour of agitation in the provinces he
was received with royal honours: the Hôtel de
Ville flung out its red hangings; and at the doors
of Ste. Gudule he was met by the canons, who
waved incense before him, and placed him on the
Emperor's <i>prie-dieu</i>. He went to the Monnaie,
where 'La Mort de César' was performed, and the
actor who played Brutus declaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>The Revolution seemed complete when the
provincial States throughout the Austrian Netherlands
proclaimed their independence, and summoned
a Congress of the United States of Belgium. But they needed men of sterner stuff than any who
could be found in the Flanders and Brabant of that time; and the end was not long in coming.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
The extreme clericals, led by Van der Noot, were
opposed by the followers of the advocate Vonck.
Van der Noot had always relied on the hope of
foreign intervention. Vonck wished the Belgians
to work out their own salvation. Van der Noot
and the Church party were obstinately conservative.
Vonck and his party wished to see the
expulsion of the Hapsburgs followed by measures
of reform. The Vonckists had the worst of the
quarrel, for the masses were against them, and
showed their sentiments in a way which those who
know Brussels will understand.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But the leaders
of the other party lacked the ability to make head
against the Austrian troops which marched into
Brabant. The volunteer army of the Catholic
Netherlands, deserted by its Prussian commander,
General Schönfeldt, was disbanded; and so the
Brabant Revolution came to naught.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></div>

<p>Joseph II. died before the end, and in the midst
of all his troubles. He had yielded much. The
seminary at Louvain was closed, and the Joyeuse
Entrée was restored. But these concessions came
too late, and, on February 20, 1790, this Sovereign
of good intentions passed away, while whispering
in the ear of the Prince de Ligne, 'Your country
has been my death.'</p>

<p>His brother Leopold reigned in his stead. The
Austrians entered Brussels on December 2, 1790;
and a week later the Ministers of Austria, Great
Britain, Russia, and Holland signed the Convention
of the Hague, which confirmed to the people
of the Catholic Netherlands all the rights and
privileges which they had enjoyed under the
Empress Maria Theresa. But now the curtain
was about to rise on a new scene in the history of
Brabant and Flanders.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>THE JACOBINS OF BRUSSELS&mdash;VISIT OF NAPOLEON&mdash;THE
HUNDRED DAYS</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">C'</span><span class="smcap">'est</span> la Belgique,' said Danton, 'qui comblera le
déficit de la Révolution.' The Convention at Paris
saw in the riches of the Austrian Netherlands a
means of filling its treasury, and supporting the
failing credit of France; and its emissaries knew
how to work upon the people of Brabant and
Flanders. 'Nous avons évangélisé partout,' was
the report sent to Paris by one of them, 'in the
streets, in the clubs, in the drinking-shops, in the
theatres.... We have covered the walls with
placards, and made the highways resound with our
hymns of liberty. We have dallied with their
fanaticism, and tried to stir up the lower ranks of
the clergy against the higher, and so kill priestcraft
by priestcraft.'</p>

<p>Meantime the army of the Republic had been at
work, and on the field of Fleurus Jourdan com
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>pleted
the conquest which Dumouriez had begun
at Jemappes.</p>

<p>Dumouriez, who understood the character of the
people he was dealing with, was all for conciliation.
He did not wish to bring the Jacobins of Paris to
Brussels, and raise up men like Chabot and Marat.
He proclaimed that the French came as friends
and brothers, and promised to secure the independence
of the country. Above all things, he
wanted to conciliate the Church. But most of the
Revolutionists sneered at the Catholicism of the
Austrian Netherlands. 'What a pity,' said Camille
Desmoulins, 'that the priests spoil the Belgians so
much. One cannot but wonder at the way in
which these people, while wishing to preserve their
liberty, try also to preserve the cowls of their
monks;' and Marat, who had no patience with the
moderation of Dumouriez, declared that nothing
would come of the war 'till a true <i>sans-culotte</i>
commands our army.' So after Fleurus the
Austrian Netherlands were made part of France.</p>

<p>The moderate democrats of Brabant had been
swamped in the early days of the French Revolution
by the extreme men who corresponded with
the Jacobins at Paris; and some strange scenes
had taken place in the venerable Grande Place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of Brussels. A Tree of Liberty was set up there,
round which men, women, and children danced
the carmagnole; and a mob went up to the Place
Royale chanting the '<i>Ça ira</i>' and roaring out the
'Marseillaise,' fastened ropes to the statue of
Charles of Lorraine and pulled it down. And it
must have been a curious sight when Dumouriez
gave receptions of an evening, and artisans rubbed
shoulders with men like the Duc d'Ursel and the
Duc d'Arenberg, who at first, like others of the
noblesse, mingled with the red-caps and joined the
Jacobin clubs, which seem to have been quite the
fashion.</p>

<p>Ridiculous things were done at the meetings of
the Jacobin clubs. The advocate Charles burns
his diploma, and says he wants no title but <i>sans-culotte</i>,
and then goes on to propose that the
names of all the squares and streets of Brussels
be changed. There should, he told his friends,
be Places d'Athènes, de Rome, de France, and
Rues de Jean-Jacques Rousseau, de Brutus, de
Voltaire, de l'Opinion, de la Philosophie, du
Divorce.</p>

<p>One wiseacre demands that the ancient constitution
of Brabant be burned on the following Sunday
during the ceremony of 'The Benediction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Flag of the <i>sans-culottes</i>.' 'Let the bust of Van
der Noot be also burned,' he added; on which
another statesman rises, and exclaims: 'Je
demande, moi, qu'on promène le Manneken de
Van der Noot avec celui de la Pinaud, sa bonne
amie.' Clearly the <i>sans-culotte</i> of Brussels was a
mere tinsel imitation of the genuine article at
Paris. At Paris all was tragedy; Brussels amused
itself with a burlesque. But as time went on, and
it dawned upon these would-be Jacobins and <i>sans-culottes</i>
that the Revolution meant fighting in the
armies of France, and that everything in Church
and State was to be turned upside-down, they
began to lose their tempers, and long before
October, 1795, when the formal incorporation with
France took place, they were quite tired of masquerading
as Jacobins.</p>

<p>Five years later they were as weary of the
Directory as they had been of the Convention;
but when, in 1803, Napoleon came to Brussels,
he was well received. There was, however, a
good deal of sham enthusiasm on that occasion,
and his most successful visit was in 1811, when he
brought the Empress Marie Louise with him.
Brussels then showed that, in spite of the Brabant
Revolution, the House of Austria had a strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
hold on the affections of the citizens. 'Voilà Marie
Louise d'Autriche!' was heard in the streets.
The town gave fêtes in her honour; and one
evening, when the Empress was at the Monnaie,
and had brought with her a bouquet of tulips from
Harlem, which fell over the edge of her box,
gentlemen ran from all parts of the theatre and
picked up the fragments, which they made into
button-holes. 'L'Impératrice parut charmée de
cette galanterie Bruxelloise,' says the local account
of this incident.</p>

<p>Napoleon was at Laeken with Marie Louise
when the campaign in Russia was resolved on.
The story goes that on receiving the news that
the Tsar refused to carry out the Continental
System, he began at once to whistle the air of
'Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre,' and ran out
into the grounds of the palace in such a rage
that he nearly knocked the Empress down. It
was at Laeken that the fatal declaration of war
was signed.</p>

<p>As soon as the Allies entered the Netherlands
after the French reverses of 1812 and 1813, they
were made welcome. Between four and five
o'clock on the evening of February 1, 1814, the
French rearguard left Brussels; and about an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
later the first Cossacks, a party of half a dozen,
rode in by the Porte de Louvain, passed quickly
through the city, and went on after the French
army. These scouts were followed by a large force
of cavalry and infantry. The Prussian infantry
found billets, and the Cossacks lay down and slept
beside their horses on the snow in the Rue des
Fripiers,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
the townsfolk standing near, and wondering
at their strange dress and language. Soon the
town was full of soldiers, some of whom remained
there, while others pressed on to France.</p>

<p>The news that Paris had capitulated reached
Brussels on March 3. The bells were rung, cannon
were fired, and the houses were illuminated. Then,
one after another, the towns which still held out
surrendered. Carnot alone, who was in command
of Antwerp, gave no sign of yielding; but in the
middle of April, while the last arrangements were
being made for the departure of Napoleon to Elba,
he pulled down the tricolor, and the great stronghold
on the Scheldt fell, with the rest of Belgium,
into the hands of the Allies.</p>

<p>It was almost a fixed rule of international
politics in Europe, when some great war was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
finished and some treaty of peace was on the
boards, that people should ask each other what was
to be done next with the Catholic Netherlands.
The rich inheritance of the House of Burgundy was
passed from hand to hand by Austrians, Spaniards,
and Frenchmen, without any statesman ever considering
what might be the wishes of the inhabitants;
and now, in 1814, the Great Powers, at first
in secret, resolved to set up a new State, consisting
of Holland and Belgium united, and call it
the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with William of
Orange-Nassau on the throne. He came to Brussels
in July, 1814, not yet as King, for the Congress
of Vienna was to settle the map of Europe and
parcel out the spoils, but as Governor on behalf of
the Allies; and at the end of the year his son, the
Prince Royal, took command of the allied army in
Belgium.</p>

<p>They had a gay time in Brussels during that
winter of 1814-15, as everyone knows. But on
March 1 the Great Man landed in France; and
a fortnight later the Orange flag was hoisted in
Brussels, and the new King announced that he
had not intended to assume the royal authority
till the work of the Congress at Vienna was
finished, and all their decisions could be executed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
together, but that the recent event in France had
made him resolve to wait no longer.</p>

<p>On April 5 the Duke of Wellington came post-haste
from Vienna, and went to live in a house
next door to the Hôtel de France, at the corner
of the Rue de la Montagne du Pare and the Rue
Royale.</p>

<p>And now during these wonderful Hundred Days,
about which so much has been written, the eyes
of all Europe were fixed on Paris and Brussels.
But there were some good folk living at Ghent,
who considered themselves as the most important
people in the world, as well they might, considering
what pains were being taken, and what
oceans of blood were to be shed, in order to make
it safe for them to depart from East Flanders and
go back again to France, whence they had lately
fled in a great hurry.</p>

<p>Louis XVIII. was lying on a sofa at the
Tuileries, suffering excruciating agonies from the
gout, when a despatch was brought to him with
the news that Napoleon had been in France for
the last five days, and was at that moment on
the road to Paris. Instantly preparations were
made for flight, with as much secrecy as they had
been made for that terrible trip in the <i>Berline
</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
on which another Bourbon had set out so many
years before. Everything was kept quiet, and
no one whom it was possible to hoodwink was
trusted. On the night fixed for the departure
one of the Ministers was at the palace. The King
gave him no hint; but as he was leaving the
captain of the guard whispered: 'We're off in
an hour; the relays are ordered; meet us at
Lille.' They started, and had a most uncomfortable
journey. It was pouring rain. The roads
were deep in mud. The royal portmanteau was
stolen with all the royal wardrobe. The royal
gout was most painful; and at Lille the garrison
was sullen. There were tricolor badges on all
sides. Eagles were pulled out of knapsacks, and
the fleur-de-lis was nowhere to be seen. This
was evidently no place to stay at long; and so
the King crossed the frontier and made for Ghent,
where he had been offered a home in the splendid
mansion of the Comte d'Hane-Steenhuyse.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> He
remained there comfortably until after the Battle
of Waterloo.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></div>
<p>People who came to Brussels in the first week
of June were surprised to find how peaceful the
town was, and how gay. Everyone has read the
narratives of what went on, and the story has been
told over and over again, and nowhere better than
in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, which is history in disguise in
the chapters where Amelia invades the Low
Countries. On June 14 Napoleon, having crossed
the frontier, was at Charleroi, on the road to
Brussels, and all Brussels was talking about the
dance which the Duke and Duchess of Richmond
were giving next day at their house in the Rue de
la Blanchisserie, in the ballroom with the paper of
'a trellis pattern with roses.'<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>It was a strange night in Brussels, that night of
June 15, 1815. By eight o'clock the Duke has
given orders for the troops to march at daybreak,
for he knows that Napoleon has crossed the
frontier. Then he goes to the ball to wait for
another despatch. At eleven o'clock, when the
dancing is in full swing, the message reaches him.
He hastens the march by two hours, and the bugles
begin to sound all over the town. 'One could
hear,' says General Brialmont, 'in the ballroom the
rolling of cannon and the steady tramp of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
regiments marching towards the forest of Soignies.'
The Duke is in bed and asleep by two o'clock; but
many of his officers dance on till it is time to rush
off to their regiments</p>

<p>It would be useless to repeat the story of the
next three days. It has been told a hundred
times. The clear, refreshing dawn; the soldiers
gathering from their billets; the partings; the
regiments marching off, the Black Watch and the
92nd Highlanders with the bagpipes playing before
them, through the park and the Place Royale, and
passing away up the Rue de Namur and along the
road beyond, to where the soft light of early
morning is beginning to shine among the glades of
Soignies; the sound of heavy firing on the 16th;
the silence on the 17th, with the news that Blucher
has lost the day at Ligny, and that Wellington is
falling back from Quatre Bras; the carts and
material of the army moving slowly up the Rue
de Namur all day long; the awful suspense of the
18th, when no one can rest.</p>

<p>'We walked about nearly all the morning,' says
Lady de Ros, 'being unable to sit still, hearing the
firing, and not knowing what was happening.'
About three o'clock the observant Mr. Creevy
went for a stroll beyond the ramparts. 'I walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
about two miles out of the town,' he writes,
'towards the army, and a most curious, busy scene
it was, with every kind of thing upon the road, the
Sunday population of Brussels being all out in the
suburbs of the Porte Namur, sitting about tables
drinking beer and making merry, as if races or
other sports were going on, instead of the great
pitched battle which was then fighting.' It was an
hour or so after this that the Cumberland Hussars
came galloping through the Porte de Namur, down
the street and across the Place Royale, shouting
that the French were coming, and raised such a
panic. It was not till late at night that the truth
was known.</p>

<p>And at Ghent? They had got on there very
well on the whole. The gout was troublesome,
but Louis XVIII. had the enormous appetite of
the Bourbons, and ate a great deal. The Comte
d'Hane gave a big dinner one day, at which the
King managed to consume a hundred oysters for
dessert. Some of the courtiers used to go to a
tavern in the suburbs and eat a small white fish,
a dainty much esteemed at Ghent, which was
caught in the river there. Chateaubriand, who was
one of this Court in exile, was at a dinner where
they sat at table from one o'clock till eight. 'They
began,' he says, 'with sweets and finished with
cutlets. The French alone know how to dine with method.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
They played whist, and went to the
theatre. Catalani sang for them at concerts, and
also in private to please the King. When the
royal gout allowed it, the King went to Mass
at the Church of St. Bavon. But during the last
three days His Majesty was very nervous, and kept
his carriage secretly ready for another flight.</p>

<h3>BRUSSELS<br /><small><span class="smcap">Rue</span> de Namur.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_230fp.jpg" alt="BRUSSELS&mdash;Rue de Namur." width="448" height="600" /></div>

<p>On the 18th, Chateaubriand was taking a walk
outside the town near the Brussels gate, when a
courier from Alost rode up with a despatch from
the Duc de Berri. 'Bonaparte,' it said, 'entered
Brussels yesterday, 17 June, after a bloody battle.
The battle was to begin again to-day. The Allies
are said to have been completely defeated, and the
order for retreat given.' All Ghent was in dismay.
The Comte d'Artois arrived and confirmed the bad
news. Many Belgians who had been in the French
army immediately started to take service once more
under Napoleon. Preparations were made for
starting at once; but at one o'clock next morning
a despatch came with the news of the victory. On
June 22 the King left Ghent, to mount once more
the throne which had been retained for him at such
a cost.</p>

<p>The scene of the great battle is wonderfully little
changed since then. The level of the ground at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the centre of the ridge occupied by the Allies has
been lowered by the removal of earth to make
the Mound of the Belgian Lion; the tree under
which the Duke of Wellington and his staff stood
at intervals during the day is gone long since; a
tramway runs past the farm of La Haye Sainte
towards Quatre Bras and Charleroi; and a number
of houses have been built on the road between
Waterloo and Mont St. Jean. But the general
aspect of the fields on which the fight took place
remains the same. Down to the right, looking
from Mont St. Jean, the château of Hougoumont,
half destroyed by shot and fire, still remains as it
was left after the battle, with its orchard walls and
tall, dark trees. The farmhouse of La Haye
Sainte, that scene of carnage, is still where it was,
at the side of the road which leads down the
incline, and then up from the narrow valley to La
Belle Alliance, near which is now the monument
of the Wounded Eagle, a memorial to the last
combatants of the army which fought and lost
with such matchless valour. Every yard of the
ground is sacred. There is, in all the world, no
spot where a Briton and a Frenchman can meet
with more profound emotions of mutual respect
than on the slopes near Mont St. Jean.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small>THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT&mdash;THE REVOLUTION
OF 1830</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">O</span><span class="smcap">ne</span> day, soon after the Battle of Waterloo, the
Tsar Alexander was at La Belle Alliance with
William, King of the Netherlands, and his son the
Prince of Orange. He asked for a glass of wine,
and drank to '<i>la belle alliance</i>, not only of nations,
but of families.'</p>

<p>The marriage of the Grand Duchess Anna
Paulowna to the Prince of Orange had just been
settled; and all the Courts of Europe believed
that the troublesome question of the Low Countries
was at last finally solved by the union of Holland
and Belgium under the dynasty of Nassau, now to
be allied by marriage with one of the Great Powers
which had placed it on the throne of the new
Kingdom.</p>

<p>The English Government had arranged that the
Prince of Orange, heir to the Kingdom of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Netherlands, should marry the Princess Charlotte,
heiress to the throne of England; and their engagement
had been announced to the States-General
at The Hague in March, 1814. But this
plan had fallen through from the causes with which
everyone is familiar&mdash;the objections of the Princess
Charlotte, who did not wish to leave England, and
liked the Prince less the more she saw of him;
her fancy for the impecunious Prince Leopold of
Saxe-Coburg, whom she afterwards married; and
the intrigues of the Grand Duchess of Oldenburgh
to break off the match, in order to bring about a
marriage between her sister, the Grand Duchess
Anna Paulowna and the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>The Prince was accordingly married to the
Grand Duchess. His character&mdash;careless, pleasure-loving,
and extravagant&mdash;made him very popular
in Brussels, and he spent as much as possible of
his time in his palace there, or at the château of
Tervueren. He preferred the Belgians to his
countrymen the Dutch, whose grave ways did not
suit him. Soon after his marriage he sent a secret
message to the Duke of Wellington, under whom
he had served in the Peninsular War and during
the Hundred Days, asking for the Duke's influence
to obtain leave to fix his Court at Brussels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Wellington refused to interfere in a domestic
question, and, in reply to the Prince's suggestion
that his presence in Brussels might help to check
discontent amongst the Belgians, said that he
doubted the statements as to Belgian disaffection,
<i>as many persons, and even nations, were interested
in breaking the union of Holland and Belgium</i>.</p>

<p>The King and Queen of the Netherlands had the
greatest difficulty in persuading the Prince to visit
them in Holland. The Communal Council of
Brussels waited on them at The Hague with an
address of congratulation on their accession. 'I
don't know,' said the Queen, 'what you do to keep
my son at Brussels; but he is so fond of you that
we hardly ever see him here.' It would have been
better for the stability of his throne if the King had
spent more of his own time in Brussels, for signs of
that discontent about which the Prince had written
to Wellington soon began to appear, and he might,
perhaps, have taken warning before it was too late,
if he had known the truth.</p>

<p>Like Joseph II., William came to the throne
full of good intentions; like him, he alienated the
clergy at the outset; and, like him, he tried to give
the Catholic Netherlands a liberal Constitution on
his own terms. His aim was to make them free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and happy, but 'Alone I did it' must be written
over all. His character was a combination of sage
ideas and Dutch obstinacy; and one great root of
bitterness between him and the clergy was that
never-ending question of education, over which
parties are fighting in Belgium at the present day.
It was not that he wished to make the southern
provinces Protestant. But he was bent on raising
the intellectual standard of the country; and for
this purpose he founded, amongst other institutions,
the Collège Philosophique at Louvain, where
the young priests were to receive a thorough
education in accordance with the spirit of the time&mdash;a
scheme which the Church resisted as it had
resisted the Séminaire Générale of Joseph II., and
with equal success.</p>

<p>In a variety of ways the King alienated the
people as well as the priests. Though the States-General
met alternately at The Hague and at
Brussels, all the great departments of the executive
were in Holland. They would, indeed, have been
safest there in the event of a war; but it was made
a grievance that some of them were not at Brussels,
Antwerp, or Ghent. Most of the officials were
Dutch, which was said to prove a wish for Hollander
supremacy, though the Dutch were a minority of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the population of the United Kingdom. The
press attacked the Government, and was severely
punished under a system of decrees emanating
from the personal authority of the King. The use
of Dutch as the official language was enforced
against the wishes of the majority. Dutch
methods of taxation were extended to Belgium,
and trouble was caused by the fact that Holland
was for Free Trade and Belgium for Protection.
And of course the southern provinces were
Catholic and the northern Protestant, which more
than anything else kept them on bad terms. At
last the impression became universal that the
King's policy was to sacrifice the interests of the
Belgian provinces to those of Holland; and the
result was that the two great parties, or schools of
thought, which had always bitterly opposed each
other, the Catholics and the Liberals, united to
oppose the Government.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
This was in 1829.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Next year the Paris revolt of July, which drove
out Charles X., and put Louis Philippe on the
throne of France, taught the Belgians how easy it
might be to get rid of a ruler with whom they
were discontented; and when the news from Paris
came to Brussels, the streets and cafés were full of
men reading the papers, and saying to each other,
'That's the way to revolt! Long live the barricades!
Long live the people!'</p>

<p>The days passed on in Brussels, with the restlessness
of the population increasing. The King's
birthday was August 24, and preparations had
been made for celebrating it with unusual brilliancy.
The park was to be illuminated, and there were to
be fireworks at the Porte de Namur. But the
people of Brussels, in that summer of 1830, were
not to be pacified by fêtes. Placards were found
posted on the walls with the ominous words: 'Le
23, Feu d'artifice; le 24, Illuminations; le 25,
Révolution.' Warnings, too, reached the Procureur
du Roi that mischief was brewing; and the
festivities were abandoned, the reason being given
that bad weather was expected!</p>

<p>On the evening of the 25th Auber's 'Muette de
Portici' was to be played at the Monnaie. This
opera had been more than once forbidden lest it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
should cause disturbances; but now permission
had been granted to perform it, and the theatre
was full. Every song of revolt was cheered, and
the climax came with the words of the duet in
Act 4:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">'Amour sacré de la Patrié,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"> Rends-nous l'audace et la fierté?'</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The audience rose and rushed out into the Place
de la Monnaie, inflamed by the songs they had
just heard, and shouting, 'Liberty! liberty!'
Then the mob gathered and rioting began. The
old flag of Brabant was hoisted on the Hôtel
de Ville, and the town was in an uproar for the
next two days.</p>

<p>Orders were sent from The Hague to put down
the 'rising' by force, and Dutch troops under the
command of Prince Frederick, the King's second
son, marched on Brussels. For nearly a month
threats, promises, negotiations were tried. But
the insurgents refused to yield. Paid agitators
went about among the people; men of high standing
took the lead in organizing the revolt; barricades
were erected; volunteers came in from all
parts; the Bishops pulled the strings behind the
scenes, and the country clergymen instigated their
parishioners to rebellion; the whole of Flanders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
and Brabant was soon up in arms, and on September
23 the Dutch advanced to attack Brussels.</p>

<p>Three days of desperate fighting in the streets
followed. The Dutch held the park in force, but
could not penetrate into the Place Royale, which
was defended by a strong barricade. Every house
in the Rue Royale was full of insurgents, who
fired from the windows on the Dutch. In other
parts of the city there was the same stubborn
resistance. For three days the struggle continued.
At sunset the firing ceased, and the working men
in their blouses sat drinking and boasting of their
exploits in the cafés, while their leaders met at the
Hôtel de Ville and took counsel for the morrow,
and the Dutch bivouacked in the park and on
the boulevards. Each morning at dawn the tocsin
sounded from Ste. Gudule, and the people rushed
to the barricades.</p>

<p>At daybreak on September 27 all was quiet when
a small party of the insurgents stole into the park,
and went forward under cover of the trees. They
found it empty. The night had been very dark,
and in the small hours the Dutch had left in
silence, and were now marching away from
Brussels.</p>

<p>It was a day of brilliant sunshine, and while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the bourdon was sounding from the towers of
Ste. Gudule, and horsemen were riding out into
the country with the news, the populace flocked
to the Palace. The men of the blouse, their hands
and faces black with gunpowder, merchants, priests,
lawyers, well-dressed ladies and ragged harridans,
boys and girls, young and old, went in, pushing,
laughing, singing. They did little damage, but
hacked and cut the portraits of the King&mdash;the
poor King who had meant so well by his kingdom.
The Queen's private rooms were examined,
and her wardrobes opened. One lad found a rich
dress, 'a magnificent robe of ceremony&mdash;white
velvet embroidered with gold.' He pulled it out,
put it on, and over it a mantle of orange colour.
With a hat '<i>a là</i> Marie Stuart' on his head, he
sallied out. The mob, crying, 'The Queen is
prisoner!' surrounded him with shouts of laughter,
and then tore off the finery and trailed it in the
dust. A marble bust of the King was brought
out. They put a crown of Dutch cheese upon
it, and carried it about with cries of 'Down with
the first and last King of the Netherlands!' Many
lives had been lost during the fighting; but this was
Brussels. It was all very different from Paris and
the downfall of Louis and Marie Antoinette.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></div>
<p>The chief work of the Congress of Vienna was
undone; and King William instructed Baron Falck,
his Ambassador at the Court of St. James's, to ask
for intervention on his behalf. The British Government
replied that troops could not be sent; that
the Five Great Powers were to meet in London;
and that the policy of Great Britain would be
to prevent the troubles in the Netherlands leading
to a breach of the peace in Europe.</p>

<p>How the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain,
France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia met in
conclave on the weary question of the Low
Countries; how this Conference of London recognized
the independence of the Catholic Netherlands,
defined their boundaries, and made them
neutral; how at the same time a National
Congress at Brussels declared that the House of
Nassau had forfeited the throne, chose as the first
King of independent Belgium Prince Leopold of
Saxe-Coburg, and framed, under the influence of
Lamennais and his disciples, a Constitution whose
democratic principles breathe the spirit of the
Joyeuse Entrée of Brabant, are events which
form a part of the general history of modern
Europe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<small>THE VICISSITUDES OF ANTWERP</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> Napoleon was at Antwerp in 1803, he
spoke to the Communal Council about the miserable
condition of the place. 'It is little better,' he
said, 'than a heap of ruins. It is scarcely like
a European city. I could almost have believed
myself this morning in some African township.
Everything needs to be made&mdash;harbours, quays,
docks; and everything shall be made, for Antwerp
must avail itself of the immense advantages
of its central position between the North and the
South, and of its magnificent and deep river.'</p>

<p>Antwerp was indeed a pitiable sight. Its trade
had sunk to nothing. Rows of squalid houses,
with wooden gables 300 years old, looked down
upon canals choked up with slime and filth. The
wharves on the banks of the noble River Scheldt
were mere heaps of rotten timber. Half the
churches, from which the stained glass and rich
ornaments of former days had long since departed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
were closed. Grass was growing in the deserted
streets; and the walls of this desolate city contained
a population which numbered only some
40,000 souls. Such in the beginning of the nineteenth
century was the state of Antwerp, which
had once been the centre of European commerce
and the greatest seaport in the world.</p>

<h3>ANTWERP<br /><small><span class="smcap">The</span> Cathedral&mdash;Chapel of St. Joseph.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_244fp.jpg" alt="ANTWERP&mdash;The Cathedral&mdash;Chapel of St. Joseph." width="428" height="600" /></div>

<p>The position of Antwerp, close to the estuary of
the mighty stream which brought it within reach
of the markets, not only of Flanders, but of every
part of the world which could be reached by water,
had made it from an early period one of the chief
cities of Brabant. But for a long time Bruges and
Ghent, after their formidable rival Ypres had sunk
into insignificance, absorbed most of the commerce
of the Netherlands. These splendid cities fell;
the commerce which had made them great found
its way to Antwerp; and by the middle of the
sixteenth century, when the waters of Zwijn,
which had carried so many costly bales to Bruges,
were drying up, the broad expanse of the Scheldt
was covered by innumerable ships threading their
way up to where the merchant princes of Italy,
Germany, and England had established themselves,
in a city which was now greater than even Venice
or Genoa.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Every week 2,000 waggons heavily laden entered Antwerp.
Silk, satin, velvet, and tapestry; gold, silver, and
precious stones; spices and sugar from Portugal and Spain,
now enriched by their conquest of the Indies; wines from
France and Germany&mdash;all found their way to
Antwerp. The manufactures of the Flemish
towns were sent down the highway of the Scheldt
to the most distant parts of the world; but England,
Spain, and Portugal were the countries to which
most of the cargoes were exported, and these were
so rich that on one occasion the contents of thirteen
ships taken by pirates were valued at 500,000
<i>écus d'or</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Already, under the Dukes of Brabant and
Burgundy, the city had grown far beyond its
original limits; but the wealth, the magnificence,
and the vastly increased population which the
remarkable prosperity of the sixteenth century
brought with it, led Charles V. to issue a decree
that the walls must be extended, and the boundaries
now became those which enclosed it until recent
times.</p>

<p>The Cathedral Church of Notre Dame, still the
glory of Antwerp, was the largest and the richest
ecclesiastical building in the Netherlands. Not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
far from the Cathedral was the Vleechhuis, now
known as the Vieille Boucherie, a solid building
of red brick relieved by courses of white stone,
with five hexagonal turrets, erected by the Guild
of Butchers, the interior of which was in those
days ornamented with elaborate carvings, paintings,
and marble statues. It is now surrounded by
mean houses in the most squalid part of the town;
but its massive appearance, even in decay, gives an
idea of the power and wealth of what was not
the most powerful nor the wealthiest of the guilds.</p>

<p>In the Grande Place, as in the Grande Place of
Brussels, were other guild houses, distinguished by
their quaint gables and towering façades, each the
home of some great corporation. There, too, was
the Hôtel de Ville, built of marble, and called 'the
wonder of the world,' lately erected to take the
place of an earlier structure which was no longer
considered worthy of the Antwerp which, having
dethroned her rival Bruges, was now called by her
proud inhabitants the 'Queen of the North.' In
all parts of this opulent city bankers and merchants&mdash;Fuggers,
Greshams, Stettens, Spinolas, and many
more&mdash;had built for themselves luxurious houses,
and met daily at the Bourse, where more business
was done than anywhere else in Europe.</p>

<h3>ANTWERP<br /><small><span class="smcap">The</span> Vieille Boucherie.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_246fp.jpg" alt="ANTWERP&mdash;The Vieille Boucherie." width="377" height="600" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></div>

<p>But within a period of ten years two events took
place, the first of which destroyed the internal
beauty of the Cathedral, and the second of
which began the downfall of the commercial
prosperity of the city.</p>

<p>In 1566 the yearly Ommegang was fixed for
Sunday, August 18. Those who have seen the
crowds which, in our own time, gather in the
towns of Belgium when the streets are perambulated
by the processions which still are so
attractive to the people of the Catholic Netherlands,
may form some conception of the intense
hostility which was excited in the hearts of the
Reformers by the superstitious reverence paid to
the jewelled image of the Virgin, which was that
day carried through the streets of Antwerp. For
the Inquisition had already been at work for fifteen
years, and thousands had already gone to the
scaffold or perished at the stake, and no man's life
was safe who did not bow the knee at the bidding
of the gloomy despot who was persecuting the
country in the name of the Catholic Church. The
image of the Virgin, the gorgeous vestments of the
priests, the ornaments of the churches, the banners
of the religious societies, the incense which filled
the air, nay, the very Host itself, were all so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
symbols of oppression. No wonder, then, that
after the procession had returned to the Cathedral
the battle-cry of 'Long live the Beggars!' was like
a match applied to gunpowder, and that the fury
of the common people broke out. Seventy marble
altars, among them an altar of the Holy Sacrament
which had been forty years in building, were destroyed.
Three organs, the finest in Christendom,
were shattered into splinters. The woodwork of the
church, stalls, confessionals, pulpits, carved chairs,
were broken up. The statues of the saints were
cast down. The magnificent vessels of gold and
silver, the richly embroidered robes and banners,
were trampled under foot. The beautifully tinted
windows were demolished. The image of the
Virgin was torn to pieces. When the work of
Vandalism came to an end, it was wonderful that
the building itself had escaped destruction.</p>

<p>No blood was shed by the Protestants when they
wrecked the Cathedral of Antwerp, not even that
of a single priest; no woman was insulted, nor was
any plunder carried away by the rioters.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But in
ten years came the orgy of robbery, murder, and
rape known as 'The Spanish Fury.'</p>

<h3>ANTWERP<br /><small><span class="smcap">Old</span> houses in the Rue de l'Empereur.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_248fp.jpg" alt="ANTWERP&mdash;Old houses in the Rue de l'Empereur." width="453" height="600" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></div>
<p>The citadel, built by Alva to overawe the town,
was occupied in 1576 by a garrison of Spaniards
whose pay was in arrears, and who cast longing
eyes on the El Dorado lying ready to their hands.
The defenders were a body of Germans and
Walloons who had just come from Brussels.
These were mercenaries and not to be depended
on, and the burghers themselves were not so hardy
as of old. On the morning of November 4 the
Spaniards, reinforced by a troop of mutineers from
Alost, rushed through a thick mist which hung
over the marshes of the Scheldt, and burst into the
city. For three long days the streets ran blood.
Men, women, and children were put to the sword
without mercy. Public buildings and private
dwellings were plundered. The whole town was
set on fire. Women were violated; there were
cruel torturings; and every possible crime was
committed. Many were drowned in the river
while trying to escape. Piles of dead lay in the
Grande Place. Of the Hôtel de Ville, where the
Burgomaster and most of the magistrates met their
death, nothing remained but the bare walls. The
archives of the city perished in the flames. Eight
thousand corpses lay among the smouldering ruins&mdash;for
this massacre was more deadly than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. 'The city,
which had been a world of wealth and splendour,
was changed into a charnel-house, and from that
time its commercial supremacy was blasted.'<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Within four years of the Spanish Fury almost the
whole trade of Antwerp had been transferred to
Amsterdam, and the time of the final catastrophe
was at hand.</p>

<p>The Pacification of Ghent, which bound all the
provinces of the Netherlands in a league against
Spain, followed hard on the Spanish Fury of
Antwerp; but the northern and the southern
provinces quickly drifted apart, and in three years
were rent in twain. The diplomacy of the Prince
of Parma was as fatal to the cause of freedom as
the fires of Alva. Holland stood firm and was
saved in the long, weary struggle. Belgium halted
between two opinions, and was lost. Brussels, the
political capital, held out until it was starved into
surrender; Bruges capitulated; and most towns of
note sooner or later were taken, or made their
peace humbly with Spain. But to obtain possession
of Antwerp was a matter of far greater
importance than the fate of any other town, and
the siege, which Parma conducted with so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
energy and skill, was the most serious military
operation during the contest in the Netherlands.
For Antwerp, though doomed to destruction
by the Spanish Fury and sinking rapidly, was
still the commercial capital of the Netherlands.
'Antwerp was the hinge on which the fate of the
whole country, perhaps of all Christendom, was to
turn. "If we get Antwerp," said the Spanish
soldiers&mdash;so frequently that the expression passed
into a proverb&mdash;"you shall go to Mass with us; if
you save Antwerp, we will all go to conventicle
with you."'<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The population was large, about one hundred
thousand. The Hôtel de Ville, the centre of the
civic life, had already been rebuilt; the city, in
spite of its frightful loss of trade, had not yet
abandoned all hope of recovering its position; and
William the Silent, before his death in 1584, had
pointed out the means of defence&mdash;to destroy the
dykes which kept the Scheldt within its bed, and
flood all the meadows round the city, so as to
prevent the Spaniards blockading the river by
erecting a bridge, which would bar the passage of
the ships on which the city would&mdash;in the event of
a siege&mdash;depend for supplies of food. This advice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
was not taken. The Guild of Butchers, whose
flocks fed on the meadows which it was proposed
to flood, objected, met in the Vleechhuis, and sent
a deputation to the magistrates, who quailed before
them. Other guilds, together with most of the
citizens, refused to believe that the Scheldt could
be bridged, and the magistrates decided not to
follow the plan of the Prince of Orange. Parma,
therefore, was able to occupy the banks of the
river, and to build forts which threatened the town
and protected the army of workmen who were soon
busily engaged in constructing the bridge which
was to close the channel. At the same time, while
his own position remained dry, the dykes at some
distance had been opened, and the plains for miles
around were turned into a waste of shallow water.</p>

<p>The siege lasted for seven months. For some
time food reached the city in ships which succeeded
in forcing their way up from Flushing and past
the Spaniards; but blockade-runners expect a big
return for their risks, and when the magistrates
were so foolish as to put a limit on the price of
wheat, the supplies from outside came to an end.
The building of the bridge went on, slowly but
surely. The weather was cold and stormy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
The river, in winter flood, made the task almost impossible;
but the Spaniards toiled on with wonderful patience and courage, and at last, on
February 25, 1585, their work was finished, and the
Scheldt was closed. The garrison made desperate
efforts by sallies, fire-ships&mdash;everything they could
think of&mdash;to destroy Parma's work, but all in vain.
The citizens trembled at the prospect of a famine.
England and Holland were sending help; but
stout hearts like those which, a century later,
maintained the defence of Londonderry till the
boom was broken, were not to be found in Antwerp.
Negotiations were opened, and, after a long time
spent in discussing terms, the capitulation was
signed on August 17, 1585. The terms of the
surrender were not hard. An amnesty was
granted, and the garrison received the honours of
war; but on one point Philip was inexorable&mdash;there
must be no liberty of conscience, no religion
but that of Rome.</p>

<p>What this meant to Antwerp was soon apparent.
The Reformation had many disciples there.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
They <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
were called upon to choose between giving up
their religion or leaving the country. A period of
two years was fixed, during which the Protestant
merchants and the Protestant workmen of Antwerp,
on whose business capacity and labour the prosperity
of the city depended, might leave their places of
business and abandon their homes; and in order
that the rising generation should breathe, from
their earliest days, a purely orthodox atmosphere,
Parma was instructed to see that the selection of
teachers was left in the hands of the Jesuits, so
that no Protestants should have a voice in the
education of the young. Antwerp suffered from
this policy of intolerance in the same way as,
exactly one hundred years afterwards, France
suffered from the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes. The flower of the population left, carrying
with them what remained of their wealth and,
a greater loss, their skill and habits of industry.
'The poor city is most forlorn and poverty-stricken,
the heretics having all left it,' were Parma's own
words.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<h3>ANTWERP<br /><small><span class="smcap">The</span> Concierge of the Musée Plantin-Moretus.</small></h3>

<p>The people of Antwerp might well have applied
to themselves the words used by Gerard Truchses
of Cologne, when lamenting the supineness of the
German Princes during the death struggle against
Rome and the Escurial: 'We shall find our
destruction in our immoderate desire for peace.'
Peace they had obtained, but a peace which
brought them no relief, and left them face to face
with starvation; for Sidney&mdash;that Sidney of whom
tradition tells the well-known story of his cup of
water given to the wounded soldier&mdash;saw to it that
not one bushel of wheat was carried up the Scheldt
past Flushing, which he held as Governor for the
Queen of England, to what was now a Spanish
town.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>For twenty-four years the Scheldt was rigorously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
blocked by the fleets of Holland; and the commerce
of Antwerp, which Parma would fain have restored,
disappeared altogether. A gleam of hope came
when, in 1609, the Twelve Years' Truce was signed
at Antwerp by the representatives of the Archdukes
Albert and Isabella and the States-General
of Holland. But the city had fallen so low that
many years would scarcely have sufficed to raise
it; and whatever progress followed the truce came
to an end with the Treaty of Münster. The
closing of the Scheldt had become a political
dogma with the Dutch; and the fourteenth article
of the treaty kept it closed against the trade of
Brabant and Flanders, to the great benefit of the
seaports of Holland.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>
<p>About the year 1590, amongst the pupils at one
of the schools established by the Jesuits at Antwerp
after the great siege, was a boy whose parents had
given him the Apostolic name of Peter Paul. His
father was Joannes Rubens, a distinguished lawyer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
who had been a magistrate of Antwerp at the time
of the image-breaking in the Cathedral, and whose
name was in the list of persons suspected of Calvinism.
The Burgomaster and magistrates solemnly
assured the Government that he was above suspicion;
but Rubens, who undoubtedly was a
Calvinist, fearing the Inquisition, left the city and
went to Germany with his wife. There he was
involved in an intrigue with Anna, daughter of the
Elector Maurice, and second wife of William the
Silent. Rubens was sent to prison, and thereafter
banished to Siegen, where his wife joined him.
The Princess, after being kept in close confinement
for some years, died in 1577. In that year, the
year before the Spanish Fury, and on June 28,
being the Eve of the Festival of St. Peter and
St. Paul, was born the boy who afterwards became
the famous painter. Ten years after the birth of
his son Joannes Rubens died at Cologne, and his
widow, returning to Antwerp, took up her abode
in the house where she had formerly lived with
her husband, in the Place de Meir. There young
Rubens passed his schooldays. If the cupboards
were bare at Antwerp at that time, the confessionals
were full, and the widow, having abjured
the errors of Calvinism, sent her son to the schools
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
which, ever since the surrender to Parma, had been
in the hands of the Catholic clergy.</p>

<p>When his education was finished he went to
learn painting from Venius, whose studio was then
in a street called the Rue Sale,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> because, it is said,
of its extreme dirtiness, and also from Van Noort,
who taught in the Rue du Jardin. Thereafter he
travelled for eight years in Italy and Spain,
gaining friends and painting, always painting, and
studying art. News reached him that his mother
was ill, and he hurried back to Antwerp, but found
on his arrival that she was already dead. Having
no longer any home ties, he was on the point of
returning to Italy, and Antwerp nearly lost him,
when the Archdukes Albert and Isabella persuaded
him to remain. This was in 1608. Next year
he married Isabelle, daughter of Jean Brant, town
clerk of Antwerp, and set up house in the Rue du
Couvent, where many of his best-known works were
painted.</p>

<p>He soon, however, built the mansion in which
he lived for the rest of his life, in what is now
called the Rue Rubens,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to the south of the Place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
de Meir. He drew the plans himself on the model
of some palace he had known in Italy, painted
frescoes on the walls, and filled it with curios he
had collected during his travels. In his large garden
he put up a domed 'Pantheon,' where he arranged
the paintings, antique statues and busts, cameos,
medals, vases of porphyry, and other treasures
which his friends in Italy sent him. His studio
was a vast room, from which the largest canvases
were easily brought down by a staircase which one
of his biographers describes as like that of a royal
palace.</p>

<p>We know a great deal about his mode of life at
Antwerp, and how he was sent journeying on
diplomatic errands by the Court of Albert and
Isabella to France, Spain, Holland, England, and
everywhere received with honour. At home, early
in the morning (he rose at four in summer), having
already been to Mass, he is at work in his studio,
and loves to listen as he paints to some friend who
will read to him from Cicero or Plutarch, or, brush
in hand, talks with endless vivacity to the guests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
who have come to call on him. After a walk in
his garden he dines frugally and very soberly, for
he dreads, we are told by Van Hasselt, the effect
of wine on his imagination; and then he works
on in his studio till late in the afternoon, when he
mounts one of his fine horses and rides till after
sunset. In the evening he sups as frugally as he
dined, and finishes the day at home in a circle
of his most intimate friends, the only society for
which he cared. This busy, happy life of Antwerp's
greatest citizen closed on May 30, 1640. The
statue in the Place Verte<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> was erected to commemorate
the two-hundredth anniversary of his
death; but the fruit of his laborious days is the
best monument of his fame.</p>

<p>Close to the Place Verte is the Marché du
Vendredi, where, in 1578, Christopher Plantin,
'the Rubens of the printing-press,' set up his
works. The story of Plantin's life is a romance
of labour. He was born at Tours in 1514, of a
wealthy family called Tercelain; but, his father
having lost his fortune, he changed his name to
Plantin, and found employment at Caen as a
bookbinder. Having married there, he went to
Antwerp, and opened a small shop, in which he worked
at his own trade while his wife sold cloth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
The story goes that one night during the carnival
he was wounded by some masqueraders, who
mistook him for another person. To hush up
the affair they paid him a sum of money, with
which he bought a press and types, began to print
almanacs and books for children, and did this so
well that he soon had a flourishing business.</p>

<h3>ANTWERP<br /><small><span class="smcap">The</span> Place Verte.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_260fp.jpg" alt="ANTWERP*mdash;The Place Verte." width="431" height="600" /></div>

<p>The first important work produced at the Plantin
Press was 'L'Instruction d'une Fille de Noble
Maison,' a translation from the Italian, which
appeared in 1555. His reputation grew, and in
thirteen years he was able to purchase the site
at the Marché du Vendredi. His name, like that
of Joannes Rubens, was on the list of suspected
Calvinists after the image-breaking, and his
printing-house was searched. But nothing was
found to support the charge of heresy, and his
orthodoxy must have been established beyond
doubt, for Philip not only employed him to
produce the famous Polyglot Bible, but gave him
the monopoly of printing missals and breviaries
for the whole of the Spanish Empire.</p>

<p>After his death in 1589, the business, which
now had branches in Paris, Leyden, and Frankfort,
was carried on by his son-in-law, Jean Mourentorff,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
whose family afterwards changed their name, in
accordance with the pedantic fashion of the day,
to Moretus. The Musée Plantin-Moretus, with
the dwelling-rooms and their Renaissance furniture;
the type and presses of the sixteenth century; the
old proof-sheets, looking as if the printer's reader
had just left them; the tapestry and paintings;
and the quaint courtyard with the aged vine-tree,
which traditions say was put there by Plantin
himself&mdash;is the place of all others where some idea
may be formed of the family life and surroundings
of a wealthy business man in the Netherlands 300
years ago.</p>

<p>But though Rubens had painted and the firm of
Plantin had printed and grown rich, the Scheldt
was all the time rolling down to the sea with
scarcely one sail upon it; and the shipping trade
of Antwerp was still at the mercy of the Dutch
when the eighteenth century came in. The
Treaty of Utrecht gave the Catholic Netherlands
to Austria, but did not free the Scheldt. On the
contrary, the stipulations of the Treaty of Münster
were confirmed; and when in 1785, a century since
Parma took Antwerp, Joseph II. demanded the
opening of the great river, this same Treaty of
Münster was unrolled as a reply. Thus, when the French
Revolution came, and the army of the Republic took
possession of the Austrian Netherlands,
the Scheldt had been blocked and the
shipping trade of Antwerp ruined for more than
200 years.</p>

<h3>ANTWERP<br /><small><span class="smcap">The</span> Musée Plantin-Moretus (the Arrière Boutique).</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_262fp.jpg" alt="ANTWERP&mdash;The Musée Plantin-Moretus (the Arrière Boutique)." width="600" height="437" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></div>

<p>In November, 1792, the Convention declared the
Scheldt a free river, and ordered its Generals to
carry out this declaration by force of arms against
the Dutch. Mr. Pitt was ready to remain neutral
in the war between France and Austria; but to
this infringement of the Treaties of Münster and
Utrecht, which had given the exclusive navigation
of the Scheldt to the Dutch, he would not agree.
Apart from the question of treaty rights, that
the coast-line from the Scheldt westwards, with
Antwerp at one end and Dunkirk at the other,
and from the Scheldt northwards to the Texel,
should be in the hands of France suggested a
constant danger of invasion; to say nothing of
possible injury to the commerce of England from
the restrictions which an unfriendly Power might
place on English trade with Antwerp, if Antwerp,
as was certain, became once more a great seaport
when the Scheldt was free. England was about
to recognize the Republic when this question of
Holland and the Scheldt made war inevitable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Thus once more Antwerp was the hinge on which
the peace of Europe turned.</p>

<p>Though the Scheldt became a French river in
1797, after the Treaty of Campo Formio, and
though the Convention of The Hague had already
abolished the shipping dues, Antwerp had made
no progress towards recovery when Napoleon went
there in 1803. He deepened the harbour, strengthened
the fortifications, expended immense sums
on improving the communications with Amsterdam
and other places in the Netherlands, and
purposed making the great seaport opposite the
mouth of the Thames his chief naval station. He
even planned the building of a new city. England
was equally aware of the value of Antwerp. The
Walcheren expedition, that costly failure,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> was
undertaken to strike a blow at this vital spot; and
the Conference of Chatillon, in 1814, broke down
because Napoleon would not relinquish Antwerp.
He could not make up his mind to let it go. Long
afterwards he said: 'Antwerp was to me a province
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
in itself. It was the principal cause of my exile to
St. Helena; for it was the required cession of that
fortress which made me refuse the terms offered at
Chatillon. If they would have left it to me, peace
would have been concluded.' And it was still in his
possession when the end came. Carnot was there&mdash;'iron
Carnot, far-planning, imperturbable'&mdash;and
held the fortress till the Emperor abdicated.</p>

<p>Trade revived with the creation of the Kingdom
of the Netherlands. By 1830 the population had
increased to between 70,000 and 80,000. There
was a strong Orange party in the city during the
Belgian Revolution, for the Scheldt is to Antwerp
what the Nile is to Egypt&mdash;its life; and the union
with Holland insured the freedom of the river.</p>

<p>Antwerp, however, suffered more at that time
from the Dutch than Brussels. General Chassé, an
old soldier of the Empire, who had lived there for
some years, was in command of the troops in the
citadel.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
He had under him between 2,000 and
3,000 men. The forts and ramparts were armed
with nearly 300 heavy guns, and in the Scheldt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
close to the town, were nine ships of war. An
exchange of shots between some of the Belgian
insurgents and the Dutch was followed by a furious
bombardment. For seven hours the citadel, the
forts on the other side of the river, and the ships
continued their fire. The houses shook with the
noise of the big guns and the rattle of musketry.
The terror and confusion were indescribable in the
streets, which were lighted up, after darkness fell, by
the flames roaring from the Church of St. Michael,
which was burned to the ground. A great deal of
damage was done, but fortunately the ships were so
close to the shore that their shot passed over the
housetops, otherwise the whole of Antwerp might
have been destroyed. The spire of the Cathedral
was a conspicuous object, rising high above the
Place Verte in the most crowded part of the town.
The shells flew past it and over it, but only three
did any harm, one bringing down a turret, and
two crashing through the roof and bursting in the
nave.</p>

<p>The wind carried the sound of the cannonade to
Brussels, where, after sunset, the people saw the sky
glowing red in the east; and some members of the
Revolutionary Government were sent to Antwerp,
who arranged an armistice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
The Dutch remained in possession of the citadel; but this bombardment,
which took place on October 27, 1830, put an end
to the last lingering hopes of a reconciliation
between the Belgian provinces and the House of
Orange-Nassau.</p>

<h3>ANTWERP<br /><small><span class="smcap">The</span> roadstead from the Tête de Flandre.</small></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_266fp.jpg" alt="ANTWERP&mdash;The roadstead from the Tête de Flandre." width="600" height="452" /></div>

<p>Since 1830 the trade of Antwerp has increased
enormously, and not very long ago the Scheldt was
so congested with shipping that no vessels were
allowed up unless they were regular liners, as there
were no free berths in the docks. This fact speaks
for itself. Antwerp is now the greatest port on the
continent of Europe. In the world London stands
first, with New York second, but Antwerp comes
third; and to meet this huge trade three miles
of additional quays are to be constructed within
the next few years. Last year the Burgomaster of
the city said that the mercantile marine of Great
Britain was so pre-eminent there that Antwerp
was, 'from a commercial point of view, one of
the most important British ports in the world.'
Germany and England, however, are engaged in a
struggle for supremacy. They are ahead of all
rivals; but the shipping companies of Hamburg
and Bremen are the most powerful in the city, and,
although during the last twenty years British trade
has steadily increased at Antwerp, German trade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
has increased still more, and seems to be rapidly
overtaking that of England.</p>

<p>The presence in force of the German element on
the banks of the Scheldt is the most striking
feature of modern Antwerp. An extraordinary
hold on its commerce and industries has been
secured, as well as on the social life of the city.
The Chamber of Commerce is full of German members.
There is a German colony many thousands
strong. There are German clubs and schools, and
numberless clerks from all parts of Germany are
to be found in business houses. These facts give
some colour to the prediction, so often heard, that
the time is approaching when Antwerp will be under
the German Zollverein, and that this will be the
first step towards the realization of those ambitions
which, beginning with a commercial alliance with
Holland and Belgium, are to find their victory
in the absorption of those countries, or, at least,
of Holland and Antwerp, in the German Empire.
It is well known that the Netherlands believe their
independence to be in danger. The Belgian Government
purposes spending millions in extending the
fortifications of Antwerp. On all hands the durability
of the settlement made by the Conference of
London in 1830-1831 is called in question.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269-270]</a></span></div>
<p>Great interests are involved; and it is within the
possibilities of the future that Antwerp may be,
yet once again, the hinge on which the peace of
Europe turns. The mouth of the Scheldt is still
where it was in the days of Napoleon&mdash;opposite the
mouth of the Thames.</p>

<h2>LIÉGE AND THE ARDENNES</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<small>THE PRINCIPALITY OF LIÉGE</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> map of Belgium during the Middle Ages, and
down to the period of the French Revolution, shows
the outlines of a large territory lying to the south
of Brabant. On the west it extends to the French
dominions; on the east are Germany and the
Duchy of Limbourg; the Duchy of Luxembourg
bounds it on the south. This territory was known
as the Principality of Liége.</p>

<p>The aspect of this part of Belgium is entirely
different from that of the other provinces. The
River Semois, rising near Arlon, the capital of
Belgian Luxembourg, flows through quiet meadows,
a slow and placid streamlet, bordered by rushes and
willow-trees, till it reaches the western extremity
of the mountainous forests of Ardennes. There it
enters a narrow winding valley, thickly wooded, with
rocky dells, and banks so precipitous that in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
places there is not even a footpath, and travellers
must pass from side to side in boats when making
their way along the margin of the stream. Emerging
from this defile, it crosses the French frontier,
and joins the Meuse near Monthermé. From
thence the Meuse flows to the north till it enters
Belgium a short distance beyond the town of Givet.</p>

<p>The romantic valley of the Meuse stretches on
for miles, past Hastière, with its abbey of the
eleventh century, peaceful Waulsort, in former
times a Benedictine settlement, but now a favourite
summer resort, and the picturesque château of
Freyr, with its well-ordered gardens. On either
side are steep slopes clothed with trees, and broken
here and there by bold, outstanding pinnacles of rock.
The sweet village of Anseremme straggles along the
road beside the river; and near it the Lesse rushes
down, between overhanging trees and towering cliffs,
to meet the Meuse. Then comes Dinant, nestling
on the right bank of the river, below the fortress
which rises on the steep hillside. From Dinant the
Meuse winds on to where the Sambre joins it at
Namur, and so onwards to Liége and Maestricht.</p>

<h3>THE CHÂTEAU DE WAULSORT ON THE
MEUSE</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_274fp.jpg" alt="THE CHÂTEAU DE WAULSORT ON THE
MEUSE" width="600" height="431" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></div>

<p>To the south of this valley of the Meuse, for
mile after mile, a broad, undulating tableland is
covered by thick forests, where deer and wild boars
abound, or opens out into a wide rolling country, dotted
with villages, farm-houses, church spires,
modern châteaux, and the ruins of feudal strongholds
perched on inaccessible rocks.</p>

<p>The appearance of this region has thus nothing
in common with any other part of Belgium, with
the flat, densely populated plain which extends
southwards from the coast of Flanders. The people,
too, are different&mdash;of quite another type, and speaking,
most of them, another tongue. For this is the
country of the Walloons, that hard-working race
whose aptitude for strenuous labour distinguishes
them from the light-hearted, easy-going people of
Flanders and Brabant, and whose language is a
form of old French mingled with words derived
from German roots.</p>

<p>While, moreover, the old-time history of northern
Belgium is the history of great commercial cities,
rolling in wealth and trading to all parts of the
world, with the merchant princes and the members
of the guilds for their great men, the history of
these southern provinces is the long story of how
the Principality of Liége was evolved out of the
chaos of small lordships which existed in the sixth
century, and was governed, not by laymen, but
by a dynasty of priests, who made war and concluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
alliances on equal terms with the surrounding
princes. It is a story of feudal barons, of the
romance of chivalry, of terrible deeds, of ferocious
bandits, of bishops who led armies into the field
and shed blood like water, often for very trifling
causes.</p>

<p>When, at the end of the fifteenth century, Belgium
was the most opulent country in Europe, the valley
of the Meuse and the wide forest of Ardennes
remained a waste. When, under the house of
Burgundy, Flanders and Brabant flourished and
grew rich, the Principality of Liége was impoverished
and steeped in misery. It remained separate
and independent, and has, therefore, a history of
its own&mdash;the history of a State governed by
the clergy, the nobles, and the people; where
taxes could not be levied without the assent of
these three estates; where no man could be condemned
except by the judges, and in accordance
with the laws; where such a thing as arbitrary
arrest was unknown, at least in theory; where the
home of the poorest subject was inviolable; but
where, in spite of all these privileges, year after year
saw one revolution follow another, all the horrors
of foreign and domestic war, and innumerable acts
of cruelty, oppression, and treachery.</p>

<h3>CHÂTEAU DE WALZIN, IN THE LESSE
VALLEY</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_276fp.jpg" alt="CHÂTEAU DE WALZIN, IN THE LESSE
VALLEY" width="404" height="600" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></div>

<p>This state of things continued, with scarcely a
pause, till the close of the seventeenth century,
after which the country, though exhausted, prolonged
its independence for another hundred years,
till, with the rest of Belgium, it was annexed to
France, and broken up into several departments.
In later days, from the fall of Napoleon and the
Congress of Vienna down to the present time, it
has shared the fortunes of the modern kingdom
of Belgium.</p>

<p>The whole story cannot be told within the
compass of a few pages; but enough may be set
down to excite, perhaps, the interest of those who
may chance to travel in this part of Europe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>EARLY HISTORY OF LIÉGE&mdash;BISHOP NOTGER&mdash;THE
COURT OF PEACE</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">A</span><span class="smcap">s</span> to the town of Liége in early times, the story
goes that one day St. Monulphe, Bishop of Tongres,
being on a journey from Maestricht to Dinant, came
to a rising ground, from which he saw a few wooden
houses nestling beneath a mountain which overlooked
the Meuse. Descending, he came to a
streamlet which flowed into the river. He asked
its name, and was told that it was called the Legia.
Then the Bishop said to his companions that a
great city, famous in the annals of the Christian
Church, would arise on that spot. He built a small
chapel there, which was replaced, in later years, by
a splendid cathedral dedicated to St. Lambert, and
laid the foundations of the temporal power of the
Bishops of Liége by endowing the Church in the
valley of the Meuse with lands which he possessed
in the neighbourhood of Dinant.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></div>

<p>But at that time, and for many years to come,
Liége was an unimportant village inhabited by a
few people; and it was not till the close of the
seventh century that it became the seat of a
bishopric, which was established there by St.
Hubert about the year 697.</p>

<p>St. Hubert was a son of the Duke of Aquitaine.
Leaving his native country for political reasons, he
took refuge at the Court of Pepin d'Herstal, father
of Charles Martel, and grandfather of Charlemagne.
Pepin's palace was then at Jupille, now a little
town on the right bank of the Meuse, some three
miles from modern Liége, but in those days the
seat of a Court, and the favourite home of Pepin,
who held royal sway over all the surrounding
country.</p>

<h3>THE EPISCOPAL PALACE&mdash;OUTER COURT,<br />
LIÉGE</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_280fp.jpg" alt="THE EPISCOPAL PALACE&mdash;OUTER COURT,
LIÉGE" width="600" height="482" /></div>

<p>The legend is well known of how Hubert was
so devoted to the chase that he used to hunt even
on the festivals of the Church, and how his conversion
was brought about by seeing a stag one
Good Friday with a shining cross between its
horns. More sober history attributes the change
of life which turned the mighty hunter into a priest
to the pious counsels of St. Lambert, Bishop of
Maestricht, who persuaded him to go on a pilgrimage
to Rome, where he finally resolved to
devote himself to the cause of religion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
He was at Rome when the news came that Lambert had been
murdered in revenge for having publicly censured
the evil life of Pepin's mistress Alpaïde. On hearing
of this tragedy the Pope made Hubert Bishop of
Maestricht, and he removed the bishopric to Liége,
which grew, under his rule, from a mere village into
a large town surrounded by walls built on land
given by Charles Martel, afterwards famous as the
great champion of Christendom at the Battle of
Tours, and son of that Alpaïde who was responsible
for the death of Lambert. Municipal
laws and courts for the administration of justice
were established, and a regular system of government
soon followed. Bishop Hubert spent much
of his time among the woods and mountains, no
longer as a hunter, but as a missionary; and the
relics of the patron saint of huntsmen, who died in
May, 727, are still preserved in a chapel at the town
of St. Hubert, which lies in the midst of a wide
forest on the southern tableland of the Ardennes.</p>

<p>Liége prospered under the Emperor Charlemagne,
who conferred important privileges on the town,
and enriched the bishops, who gradually acquired
that temporal power which they wielded for so
long a time, after the vast empire of Charlemagne
had fallen to pieces during the ninth century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>The real founder of the temporal power of the
bishop princes of the Principality of Liége seems
to have been Notger, who was made Bishop by
Otho the Great in the year 971. He strengthened
the walls of the town, and made it known that law
and order must be maintained within the diocese.
But the great nobles had their feudal castles, from
which they sallied forth to plunder and oppress
their weaker neighbours, and close to Liége was
the castle of Chèvremont. This stronghold stood
on a hill near the site of the modern watering-place
of Chaudfontaine, and was surrounded by the cottages
of the baron's vassals, and by several chapels
and religious houses founded by fugitives who had
taken refuge there during the years of the Norman
invasion, when Liége, Maestricht, Tongres, and the
rich abbeys of Malmedy and Stavelot, had been
laid waste.</p>

<p>When Notger came to the See of Liége, Immon,
the châtelain of Chèvremont, was the terror of the
whole country for miles around. He raided the
villages, carried away the crops from the few cultivated
fields, and sometimes rode into the suburbs
of Liége, made prisoners of the inhabitants, and
held them to ransom. The people implored Notger
to protect them, but for a long time he could find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
no means of subduing, or making terms with, his
formidable neighbour. At last, however, he saw an
opportunity. The lady of Chèvremont having
given birth to a son, her husband, being resolved
that only some high dignitary of the Church should
have the honour of baptizing his heir, requested
the Bishop of Liége to perform the ceremony.
Notger hesitated, but in the end sent a message
that he would do what was required of him.</p>

<p>On the appointed day the Seigneur of Chèvremont
from his watch-tower saw the Bishop approaching
the castle at the head of a long procession of priests
clothed in gorgeous vestments, and chanting psalms.
Praising the zeal of the prelate who had come to
baptize his son with such unusual pomp, he ordered
the drawbridge to be lowered and the gates of the
castle to be opened. The procession entered, and,
when all were assembled in the courtyard, Bishop
Notger addressed Immon.</p>

<p>'Seigneur,' he said, 'this castle is no longer yours,
but mine.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' asked Immon.</p>

<p>'I say,' replied the Bishop, 'that this place belongs
to me, the only lord of the country. Immon,
yield to necessity, and depart. I promise to give
you full compensation.'</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></div>
<p>'It is fortunate for you,' exclaimed the châtelain,
in a fury, 'that you entered my castle under a promise
of safety, for otherwise you leave it torn in
pieces! Scoundrel! Miserable priest! Fly, lest
some evil befall you!'</p>

<p>Instantly Notger gave a signal to his followers,
who, throwing off the surplices, albs, and other
ecclesiastical vestments which had covered their
armour, and drawing the swords which had been
concealed about them, rushed upon the inhabitants
of the castle, and slaughtered them without mercy.
It is said that Immon threw himself in despair over
the walls, and that his wife perished miserably with
her infant son. The castle was razed to the ground;
the religious houses which clustered round it were
destroyed; and the revenue of the chapels, which
were also laid in ruins, served to enrich the churches
of Liége and Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<h3>PONT DES ARCHES, LIÉGE</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_284fp.jpg" alt="PONT DES ARCHES, LIÉGE" width="416" height="600" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></div>

<p>Whatever may now be thought of this episode
in church history, it made Bishop Notger more
popular than ever. Otho the Great and his successors
added to the gifts by which Charlemagne
had enriched the bishopric; and in 1006, two years
before the death of Notger, the Emperor Henry II.
confirmed all these donations by a charter, in which
Namur, Dinant, Tongres, Maestricht, Malines, Gembloux,
St. Hubert, and other important places
are named as pertaining to the diocese of Liége.
Thus, at the beginning of the eleventh century, the
Bishop of the Principality was already possessed
of extraordinary power. A few years later the
Countess of Hainaut, being then at war with
Flanders, sought an alliance with the Bishop of
Liége, and, in return for his help, accepted him as
her feudal superior; and the Counts of Hainaut,
themselves amongst the proudest nobles of that
day, were vassals of Liége until the times of
Charles the Bold.</p>

<p>The frightful anarchy of the feudal period was
nowhere worse than in this part of Europe.
Murders, acts of revenge, robberies, took place
without end. A state of war was the normal
condition of society in the Valley of the Meuse and
throughout the Ardennes. Noble fought against
noble, and vassal against vassal. By the law or
custom of these days, the feudal barons had the
right of settling their disputes by force of arms;
and their prince could not forbid them. But,
though he could not interfere in his secular character,
he could do so as bishop; and the influence
of the Church, though the bishops themselves
were often arrogant and ambitious, had been used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
to promote the cause of peace by proclaiming a
truce of forty days, during which prayers were
offered up for the souls of those who had fallen
in battle. A 'quarantaine,' as it was called, being
appointed for the death of each knight, there was
sometimes a whole year of peace, during which
enemies met on outwardly friendly terms, visited
each other's châteaux, and went together to
tournaments or village fêtes. Sometimes, during
these periods of repose, families which had been
at deadly feud intermarried, and ladies who had
been made widows, or daughters who had become
orphans, married the very warriors who had slain
their husbands or fathers. But more frequently, as
soon as the 'quarantaine' was over, every one set to
work again, burning houses and killing each other
as before.</p>

<p>At last Henri de Verdun, who became Bishop of
Liége in 1075, resolved to stop, if possible, the
private wars which were the scourge of society.
He assembled the nobles of the Principality and
the surrounding districts, and urged upon them
the necessity of at least making an effort to put
an end to the ceaseless strife in which they lived.
'The only means I can think of,' he said, 'is to
choose a supreme judge, with power to punish
those who are guilty of excesses.' The nobles
consented to this  proposal. He himself was
appointed to the new office, and his successors
in the bishopric of Liége were declared, for all time
coming, judges of the 'Court of Peace.'</p>

<h3>ESCALIER DE LA FONTAINE, LIÉGE</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_286fp.jpg" alt="ESCALIER DE LA FONTAINE, LIÉGE" width="424" height="600" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></div>

<p>The rules of the 'Tribunal de Paix de Liége'
decreed that on certain days it was unlawful to
carry arms, and that any freeman who committed
murder or acts of violence should be deprived
of his estate and expelled from the Principality,
while a slave was to be punished by the loss of
whatever he might possess, and have his right
hand cut off. From Wednesday to Monday,
during the festivals of the Church, the <i>Trève de
Dieu</i> was to be strictly observed. The Peace
Tribunal was to decide cases of assassination, rape,
incendiarism, robbery, and other offences which
might lead to a breach of the public peace. Anyone
who did not appear before the court, after
being duly cited, was to be declared infamous, and
was liable to a sentence of excommunication. But
the accused could&mdash;such was the warlike spirit of
the times&mdash;always claim to have his case decided by
judicial combat.</p>

<p>The Dukes of Bouillon and Limbourg, together
with the Counts of Luxembourg, Louvain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Namur, Hainaut, Montaigu, Clermont, and La
Roche, signed the Act which established the
'Tribunal de Paix '; and they all swore to obey its
decisions, except the Count of La Roche, who
refused to take any oath whatever.</p>

<p>On this the other barons made war upon him,
and defeated him in a pitched battle. He fled
to his castle and stood a siege of seven months, till,
his provisions being exhausted, he saw nothing
before him but surrender or starvation. Suddenly
he thought of a stratagem. He fed a sow, the only
animal which remained alive in the castle, with his
last measure of wheat, and let it escape. The
besiegers killed it, and, finding that it had just had
a full meal, came to the conclusion that it was
useless to continue the siege, as the garrison
seemed well supplied with food. They therefore
made peace with the Count of La Roche, who
thus remained free from the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal de Paix. The other barons also excused
themselves; so did the clergy; and, in the end, the
burghers of Liége refused to accept the decisions of
the court, when, at the beginning of the thirteenth
century, they obtained a great extension of their
privileges under a charter granted by Albert de
Cuyck, who had come to the episcopal throne in 1195.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></div>
<p>Whenever there was a vacancy in the See of
Liége, all the princes of Belgium, and often those
of other countries, tried to obtain the nomination
for one of their relatives. In the year 1193 Albert
de Louvain, who had been chosen against the wish
of the Emperor Henry IV., was murdered at
Rheims by a band of German knights, probably
under secret orders from the Emperor, who forthwith
put forward Simon de Limbourg, then only
sixteen years of age, as Bishop of the Principality.
Simon de Limbourg was supported by the Duke of
Brabant; but the Counts of Flanders, of Namur,
and of Hainaut, refused to accept him. The Pope
suspended his election, and Albert de Cuyck,
backed up by the Count of Hainaut, took possession
of the bishopric, and went to Rome to prosecute
his claim against that of Simon de Limbourg, which
was still maintained before the Holy See. Simon
de Limbourg died, or was made away with, at
Rome, and de Cuyck became Bishop.</p>

<p>He was now deeply in debt, having borrowed
a large sum from the Count of Flanders, and spent
it at Rome in bribery to secure his election as
Bishop. This debt he got rid of by the sale of
civil offices and ecclesiastical benefices; but more
money was needed at Liége in order to repair the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
walls of the town. For this purpose a tax was laid,
by decree of the Bishop and the civil magistrates,
on the people and the clergy. The latter refused
to pay, on the ground that they had not been
consulted. The magistrates and the laity insisted
that the clergy must bear their share of the
common burden. The Bishop took the side of the
people against the clergy, and in order to make
himself popular granted a charter, which was
confirmed by the Emperor Philip II. in 1208.</p>

<p>This charter of Albert de Cuyck is an important
landmark in the constitutional history of the
Principality of Liége. It declared that the people
might not be taxed without their own consent. It
relieved them from the burden of lodging and feeding
armed men, a constant source of discontent at
that time; and it freed them from being compelled
to follow the Bishop into battle, unless he was
making war in defence of the Principality, and
even then not till fifteen days after he had
assembled his own immediate vassals. It provided
that no officer of the law might enter a house to
search for a thief or for stolen property without
leave from the owner of the house. No freeman
could be arrested or imprisoned except under a
legal warrant. The justices of the town were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
be the only judges in a trial for any crime committed
within the walls. No stranger might challenge a
burgher of Liége to trial by combat, but must
prosecute him before the judges. During eight
days before Christmas and Easter no arrest for
debt was allowed, though at other times a debtor,
against whom judgment had been given, must
either pay at once, find security before sunset, or
go to prison.</p>

<p>These, and other provisions of a similar nature,
were the regulations set forth in the charter of
Albert de Cuyck, the principles of which were afterwards
embodied, from time to time, in other public
Acts. It was, like the Joyeuse Entrée of Brabant,
merely a declaration of rights, many of which had
previously existed; but it gave these rights the
sanction and authority of written law. Thenceforth
the people began to assert themselves, and for many
long years to come the history of Liége is a record
of revolutions and intestine wars, the populace
rebelling either against the bishops or the barons,
and of feuds between the bishops and the barons,
in which the populace took part, sometimes on one
side and sometimes on the other. The people of
the Principality, as soon as they had obtained the
charter, refused to accept the jurisdiction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Peace Tribunal. Disputes were not settled, and one
private war followed another.</p>

<p>The most trifling incident was often the cause of
a sanguinary struggle; but perhaps the most foolish
of all was that known as the <i>Guerre de la Vache de
Ciney</i>.</p>

<h3>THE HOSPITAL, DINANT</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_292fp.jpg" alt="THE HOSPITAL, DINANT" width="422" height="600" /></div>

<p>A peasant of the province of Namur, named
Jallet, went to a fair at Ciney, the chief town in the
district of Condroz, in the forest of Ardennes, and
there stole a cow belonging to one of the townsmen.
He took the animal to Andenne, on the
Meuse between Liége and Huy, where the Duke
of Brabant and the Counts of Namur and Luxembourg,
with many knights and ladies, had met for
a tournament. One of the company was Jean de
Halloy, the baillie of Condroz, and to him the
owner of the cow, who had followed the thief, complained.
The baillie promised pardon to Jallet on
condition that he would take the cow back to Ciney.
Jallet started, driving the wretched beast before
him, but as soon as he entered the district of Condroz,
the baillie had him arrested and hanged. On
this Jean de Beaufort, feudal lord of Goesnes, the
village in which Jallet had lived, assembled his
friends, and proceeded to attack Condroz. Then
the people of Huy flew to arms, and burned the château of Goesnes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293-294]</a></span>
Forthwith the Duke of Brabant, with the Counts of Flanders,
Namur, and Luxembourg, joined in the fray, burned the town
of Ciney, and threatened to devastate all the
country round Liége. Next the people of Dinant
came on the scene, invaded Namur and Luxembourg,
burned many villages in the Ardennes, and
slaughtered the villagers. For three years the war
continued, until at last, when, it is said, no fewer
than 20,000 people had been killed, and the whole
country of the Ardennes, from Luxembourg to the
Meuse, had been laid waste, the combatants came
to their senses. It was resolved to end the struggle
by arbitration. Philip the Hardy, King of France,
agreed to act as peacemaker, and, being of opinion
that both parties were equally to blame, decided
that each must bear its own losses! History says
nothing about what became of the cow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>THE DUKES OF BURGUNDY&mdash;DESTRUCTION OF LIÉGE
BY CHARLES THE BOLD</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> whole story of Liége and the Ardennes is full
of episodes, like the war of the cow of Ciney. It
would be easy to fill volumes with tales of adventures
in the Valley of the Meuse, and under the
walls of Liége&mdash;how castles were taken by
strategy or by open assault; how ladies were
carried off, and rescued by some daring feat of
arms; how desperate encounters were fought out
in the depths of the forest; how bandits roamed
about, killing and robbing as they pleased; how
almost the only place where a woman felt safe was
a convent; how the peasants were oppressed;
and how the common people of the towns lived in
a state of chronic mutiny. All these things make
up the story of how men and women lived in what
is now one of the most peaceful regions in Europe.
The glamour of chivalry does not conceal the fierce
and revengeful spirit of every class. A history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
this part of Belgium, written as Sir Walter Scott
wrote the history of Scotland, would be as entertaining
as the 'Tales of a Grandfather.'</p>

<p>Nowhere could a richer field be found for the
plots of historical fiction; and it is not strange
that the author of 'Ivanhoe' should have chosen it
as the scene of a romance. In 'Quentin Durward'
history is, of course, subordinate to fiction. The
murder of the Bishop of Liége is represented as
taking place fifteen years before its real date. The
description of the tragedy has no resemblance to
what actually happened. The people of the Principality
are made to speak Flemish instead of
French or their native Walloon. But such dry-as-dust
criticisms would be absurd, and the 'true king
of the romantics' has reproduced, with inimitable
skill, the spirit of the long, bloody drama in which
Louis of France and Charles of Burgundy were
the chief actors.</p>

<h3>LA MAISON CURTIUS, LIÉGE</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_296fp.jpg" alt="LA MAISON CURTIUS, LIÉGE" width="394" height="600" /></div>

<p>About the middle of the fifteenth century the
House of Burgundy was at the summit of its power,
and held sway over Flanders and Brabant, Hainaut,
Namur, and Luxembourg. But the ecclesiastical
Principality of Liége, though wedged in between
Brabant, Luxembourg, and Namur, remained a
separate state. Ever since the charter of Albert de Cuyck the power of the commons had grown, and
with it their determination to maintain their liberty and independence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Nor were the nobles more inclined to exchange the
bishops for other rulers,
especially if these were to be the Dukes of Burgundy.
For the House of Burgundy had been
detested in Liége since the winter of 1408, when
Bishop John of Bavaria&mdash;<i>Jean sans Pitie</i>, as he was
called by his subjects&mdash;had crushed a revolution,
which his tyranny had produced, by calling to his
aid the Duke of Burgundy and the Counts of
Hainaut and Namur. On November 24, 1408,
in a battle at Othée, near Tongres, the revolutionary
army of Liége, 30,000 strong, had been defeated,
and a massacre followed, the horrors of which
had never been forgotten. The triumph of John
of Bavaria and his merciless oppressions were due
to the support which he received from the arms of
Burgundy, and the result was that afterwards,
during the struggle between Philip the Good,
Duke of Burgundy, and France, the sympathies of
Liége were always on the side of France.</p>

<p>In 1430, when Jean de Heinsberg was Bishop of
Liége, the Burgundian Governor of Namur forbade
the town of Dinant to repair its walls. The men
of Liége marched towards Dinant, burning castles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
and villages on their way. Another war seemed
inevitable; but the Bishop, who had accompanied
the army, apparently against his will, prevented
this calamity by going on his knees to Philip and
humbly asking pardon for the excesses which his
vassals had committed. The people of Liége,
however, indignant at this humiliation, became so
turbulent that the Bishop was several times on the
point of resigning. It appears, nevertheless, that
his resignation was forced upon him by the Duke
of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Heinsberg had promised a certain benefice to
Louis de Bourbon, the Duke's nephew, but gave it
to another claimant. Philip having sent an envoy
to demand an explanation, the Bishop said: 'Let
His Highness have patience. I intend him for
a better benefice than that.' 'Which?' he was
asked. 'The one I hold myself,' he replied. He
soon repented of this rash promise, and was about
to journey into France and ask protection from the
King, when Philip invited him to The Hague.
There he was treated with all honour till the day of
his departure, when the Duke suddenly asked him
if he intended to fulfil his promise about the
bishopric. Heinsberg declared that he would
certainly keep his word, but was, in spite of what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
he had said, taken into a dark room, where he
found a Franciscan and an executioner, clothed in
black and armed with a naked sword, awaiting him.
'Most Reverend Seigneur,' said the Franciscan,
'you have twice broken faith with the Duke.
Resign at once, or prepare to die.'</p>

<p>At these words, so the story goes, Bishop Heinsberg
was so terrified that he signed his resignation
on the spot in favour of Louis de Bourbon, who
was not yet in Holy Orders, and was, indeed, a mere
youth of eighteen, a student at the University of
Louvain, whither his uncle had sent him to be
educated. The Chapter of St. Lambert, by whom
the bishops had always been chosen, complained;
but the appointment was confirmed by the Holy
See, and the whole spiritual and secular administration
of the Principality passed into the hands of the
young prelate.</p>

<p>This was a triumph for the House of Burgundy,
which had long aimed at extending its influence to
the Principality of Liége; but in it few years the
clergy, the nobility, and the people united against
the Duke's nephew, and combined to drive him
from the management of their affairs. In order to
protect themselves against Philip, who might
interfere on behalf of his nephew, they appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
as regent Mark of Baden, brother-in-law of the
Emperor Frederick III., who came to Liége
attended by a body of German troops.</p>

<p>The prospect of a war in the Belgian provinces,
which would compel the Duke of Burgundy to
withdraw a part of his army from France, was
hailed with joy by Louis XI. He promised help,
both in men and money, to the people of Liége,
who forthwith assembled in arms. Charles the
Bold, Philip's son, at that time known as the
Comte de Charolais, was then fighting in France;
but a force of Burgundians, sent by his father, had
no difficulty in defeating the raw army of Liége,
which, left to its own resources by the Germans,
was cut to pieces on the field of Montenac in the
autumn of 1465. Louis XI., instead of coming to
the assistance of the Liégeois, sent a letter advising
them to make peace with Philip before the redoubtable
Comte de Charolais made his appearance in
their territory; and a convention was signed which
laid the Liégeois at the feet of the Duke of
Burgundy, who became Regent of the Principality.
Peace was duly proclaimed at the Perron in the
market-place of Liége. But the ruling party at
Dinant were so foolhardy as to declare war against
Namur. On this Charles the Bold besieged Dinant.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></div>
<p>Messengers sent from the Burgundian camp
with a summons to surrender were murdered by
the townsmen, who in a short time saw their walls
breached by heavy guns brought from the arsenals
of Brabant. Then they offered to negotiate for a
capitulation, but the offer was refused. Dinant
was taken, sacked, and burned. The Hôtel de
Ville was blown up by an explosion of gunpowder.
The cathedral was almost entirely destroyed. A
number of wealthy citizens who had been made
prisoners and confined in a building adjoining the
cathedral were burned alive. Eight hundred
persons, tied together in pairs, were thrown into
the Meuse and drowned. The work of vengeance
was not finished until every house had been
demolished; for Charles of Burgundy had declared
that a day would come when travellers, passing up
the Valley of the Meuse, would ask where it was
that Dinant had once stood.</p>

<p>Philip the Good died at Bruges in June, 1467,
and Charles the Bold became Duke of Burgundy.
The new reign began with troubles in Flanders
and Brabant, and these had scarcely been overcome
when there was a fresh rising at Liége, so dissatisfied
were the people with the terms of peace,
which, arranged after the terrible Battle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Montenac, left them subject to the House of
Burgundy. Frenchmen, sent by the King on the
pretext of mediating between Louis de Bourbon
and his vassals, encouraged the popular discontent,
which rose to such a height that the town of Huy,
where the Bishop lived, was attacked and plundered.
The Bishop fled to Namur, but some of his servants
and some partisans of Burgundy were slain.
Charles, exasperated beyond all bounds, marched
against Liége. On his arrival, 300 of the burghers
came forth, imploring mercy and offering him the
keys of the town. He spared their lives, but only
on the condition that he was to enter the town and
there dictate his own terms. This condition was
accepted, and Charles rode in. The Bishop of
Liége and Cardinal La Balue, the Ambassador of
Louis XI., were with him. On one side of the
street stood the burghers, and on the other the
priests, all as penitents, with heads uncovered and
torches in their hands. Charles dismounted at the
Bishop's palace, where, a few days later, in the presence
of a vast assemblage of people, he pronounced
sentence on the town and Principality of Liége.</p>

<p>Most of the privileges which had been granted
from time to time since the charter of Albert de
Cuyck were abolished. An appeal from the civil judges
to the Bishop and his council was established.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
The seat of the bishopric was removed from Liége,
and it was ordained that the spiritual court was to
sit at Maestricht, Louvain, or Namur. The Bishop
was forbidden to levy taxes on produce carried up
or down the Meuse without leave from the Duke
of Brabant, and the Counts of Hainaut and Namur.
It was decreed that the people of the Principality
must never take arms against Burgundy, go to war,
or make alliances without the Duke's permission.
The walls and gates of Liége, and of all other
towns in the Principality, were to be destroyed;
the manufacture of arms was forbidden; the
Perron was to be removed, and the Duke was to do
with it as he pleased.</p>

<h3>LE ROCHER BAYARD, DINANT</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_302fp.jpg" alt="LE ROCHER BAYARD, DINANT" width="399" height="600" /></div>

<p>These articles, and many more, all of them
framed for the purpose of curbing the spirit of the
Liégeois, were embodied in the deed which was
read aloud in the Bishop's palace on November 26,
1467. The Bishop and all the notables having
sworn to obey it, Charles told them that if they
kept true to their oath he, in return, would protect
them. The sentence which was thus pronounced
was rigorously executed. Many of the popular
faction fled to France; others took refuge among
the Ardennes; some were executed. The Perron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
was carried away to Bruges, and there engraved
with an inscription full of insults to the people
of Liége; the walls of the town were thrown
down; spies went about the country districts
watching the villagers and gathering information.
So universal was the feeling of suspicion and fear,
and so heavy were the taxes levied on the wealthy,
that many families abandoned all their possessions
and went into exile.</p>

<p>These doings had been watched at Rome; and
presently a papal legate, the Bishop of Tricaria, came
to Liége, and advised Louis de Bourbon to resist
the violence of the Duke's agents, and recall by
degrees those who had fled or been banished from
the country. But the youthful Bishop preferred to
live at Brussels, where the brilliant and luxurious
life of the Burgundian Court was in full swing.
He took such delight in the fêtes for which the
gay capital of Brabant was famous that he actually
attempted to reproduce them in his own desolate
Principality, and on one occasion came sailing up
the Meuse from Maestricht in a barge painted with
all the colours of the rainbow, and made his appearance
before the ruined walls of Liége surrounded
by musicians and buffoons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the dark recesses of the Ardennes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
a band of the exiles had been wandering about,
sleeping on the bare ground in the open air, clothed
in rags, starving, and ready for mischief. These
men, under the leadership of Jean de Ville, hearing
that Liége was unguarded, and that war was likely
to break out once more between Burgundy and
France, marched from the forest to Liége, and
complained to the Pope's legate. He went to the
Bishop, who was then at Maestricht, and laid before
him the miserable condition of the country. The
Bishop promised that he would return to Liége;
but Charles the Bold, from whom nothing was hid,
wrote and told him that, as soon as he had settled
his affairs with the King of France, he was coming
to the Principality to punish these new rebels
against his authority. On this the Bishop, instead
of going to Liége, went with the legate to Tongres.</p>

<p>This desertion drove Jean de Ville and his
followers to despair. They made a night march to
Tongres, surprised the Bishop's guards, some of
whom they killed, and persuaded, or, rather, compelled,
Louis and the Pope's legate to come with
them to Liége. The war on which the insurgents
counted when they thus captured the Bishop did
not break out. On the contrary, negotiations had
commenced, and ambassadors from France were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
discussing terms of peace with Charles at the very
time of the raid on Tongres.</p>

<p>The summer of 1468 was a time of splendour at
the Court of Burgundy. On June 25 Margaret of
York, attended by a brilliant company of English
lords and ladies, sailed into the harbour of Sluis,
where she was met by Charles the Bold. A week
later they journeyed by the canal to the ancient
town of Damme, where their marriage was celebrated
at five o'clock on the morning of July 3.
On that same day they entered Bruges in state,
followed by a train of sixty ladies of the greatest
families of England and Burgundy, and surrounded
by nobles and princes who wore the Order of the
Golden Fleece. The famous tournament of the
Tree of Gold was held, after the marriage feast, in
the market-place, and the revels continued for
eight days longer. All was bright and gay in
Flanders; but far away among the Ardennes dark
clouds were gathering over the Valley of the Meuse.</p>

<p>In the beginning of October the headquarters of
the Burgundian army were at Peronne on the
Somme. Louis XI. went thither with only a
small escort, and sought an interview with Charles.
Whatever his motive may have been for putting
himself in the power of his rival, he had soon good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
reason to repent of his rashness. A party of
Burgundians from Liége arrived at Peronne, accused
the rebels of gross cruelty to the Bishop and
to the Duke's friends, and asserted that some
Frenchmen had taken part in the affair at Tongres.
Charles, on hearing their statements, burst into one
of his fits of uncontrollable anger. 'I know,' he
cried, 'who is at the bottom of all this,' and forthwith
locked up the King of France in the citadel
of Peronne. After three days, during which Louis
went in fear of his life, and Charles meditated all
sorts of vengeance, the King was set free, and swore
a solemn oath that he would assist Charles to
punish the Liégeois.</p>

<p>Then the allied forces of France and Burgundy
marched into the Principality. When they approached
Liége the Bishop and the papal legate
met them, and endeavoured to make terms for the
people, throwing themselves on their knees before
Charles, and beseeching him not to punish the
innocent and the guilty alike. The Bishop, it was
pointed out, had pardoned the affront which he
had received; but the Duke forbade them to speak
of pardon. He was master, he said, of the lives
and property of these incorrigible rebels, and he
would do with them as he pleased. After this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
there was nothing more to be said. The doom of
Liége had been spoken.</p>

<p>A sally, made during the night by Jean de Ville
and his men, though it threw the Burgundian outposts
into confusion, had no effect but to increase
the Duke's anger; and on Sunday, October 30, he
entered the town at the head of his army, passing
over the ruins of the old walls. There was no
resistance. The streets were empty. The wealthier
inhabitants, and all who had made themselves prominent
in the recent disturbances, had fled to the
Ardennes with their families, taking away as many
of their possessions as they could carry. A great
multitude of poor people, women, children, and
old men, had concealed themselves in the cellars of
their houses. Charles and the King rode through
a deserted town till they came to the Hôtel de
Ville. Here the Duke waved his sword on high,
and shouted, 'Vive Bourgoyne!' The King of
France drew his, and shouted likewise, 'Vive
Bourgoyne!' and at this signal 40,000 soldiers
were let loose.</p>

<h3>OLD HOUSE OF THE QUAI DE LA GOFFE,
LIÉGE</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_308fp.jpg" alt="OLD HOUSE OF THE QUAI DE LA GOFFE,
LIÉGE" width="600" height="478" /></div>

<p>The people were dragged from their places of
concealment and slain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Many who escaped immediate death ran to the
churches for shelter. The priests, with crucifixes
in their hands, came to the doors and implored the
soldiers not to enter. They were cut down, and those
whom they had tried to protect were killed,
even on the steps of the altars.
Old men and children were trampled underfoot.
Young girls were outraged before their mothers'
eyes, or put to death, shrieking and imploring
mercy. Churches, convents, private houses were
alike pillaged. Tombs were broken open in the
search for plunder, and the bones of the dead were
thrown out. Those who were suspected of possessing
valuables were tortured to make them confess
where their treasures were hidden. As the day
went on every street in Liége ran with blood like
a slaughter-house, till at last the soldiers grew
tired of killing their victims one by one, and, tying
them together in bundles of a dozen or more
persons, threw them into the Meuse, where men
and women, old and young, perished in one struggling
mass. It is said that nearly 50,000 died,
most of them in the town or by drowning in the
river, but many from cold and famine among the
Ardennes.</p>

<p>The horrors of the sacking of Dinant had been
surpassed. Charles, however, was not yet satisfied.
His real wish was to wipe Liége from the face of
the earth&mdash;to destroy it utterly; but before doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
so, he made a pretence of consulting Louis of
France. The King, who understood him thoroughly,
replied: 'Opposite my father's bedroom there was
a tree, in which some troublesome birds had built
their nest, and made such a noise that he could not
sleep. He destroyed the nest three times, but they
always returned. At last, on the advice of a friend,
he cut down the tree, and after that he was able to
repose in peace.'</p>

<p>Charles took this hint as it was meant, and gave
orders that Liége was to be set on fire, and every
building of stone, except the churches and the
houses of the clergy, pulled down. These orders
were carried out to the letter. The flames consumed
row after row of houses, and any edifice not
made of wood was undermined by the pickaxes of
an army of workmen who laboured for seven weeks,
till at last nothing remained of Liége but churches
and the dwellings of the priests standing forlorn
amidst a heap of smoking ruins. While the work
of destruction was in progress Charles embarked
for Maestricht, sent the Pope's legate back to Rome
with the news of what had befallen the bishopric
of Liége, and, having ravaged all the country for
miles around, departed for his own dominions.</p>

<p>The years passed on, and at last there came a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
time when the voice which shouted 'Vive Bourgoyne!'
in Liége was silent, the sword fallen from
the hand which had waved it as a signal for the
massacre, and the proud head of the conqueror
brought very low. On Tuesday, January 7, 1477,
two days after the fight at Nancy, in which Duke
René of Lorraine had defeated the Burgundian
army, a young page, Jean Baptiste Colonna, son of
a noble Roman house, was guiding a party who
were searching for the body of Charles the Bold to
where he thought he had seen his master fall during
the battle. Not far from the town, near the chapel
of St. Jean de l'Atre, they found a heap of dead
men lying naked among snow and ice and frozen
blood in the bed of a small stream. One of the
searchers, a poor washerwoman who had served in
the Duke's household, saw a ring which she recognized
on a finger of one of the corpses, and exclaimed:
'Ah! Mon Prince!' When they raised
the head from the ice to which it was frozen the
skin of one cheek peeled off. Wolves or dogs had
been gnawing the other. A stroke from some
battle-axe had split the head down to the chin.
But when the blood had been washed from the
disfigured face it was known, beyond all doubt, for
that of Charles the Bold.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></div>

<p>They buried him before the altar of St. Sebastian
in the Church of St. George at Nancy, where the
body of the great warrior remained till 1550. when,
in the reign of Charles V., it was carried into
Flanders, and laid beside that of his daughter
Marie in the choir of Notre Dame at Bruges.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>THE WILD BOAR OF ARDENNES</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">hough</span> the churches and the houses of the clergy
had been left standing, in accordance with the orders
given by Charles the Bold in 1468, the town of
Liége was ruined. After a time, however, those
who had escaped with their lives began to return,
and by degrees a new Liége arose. The Principality
also recovered to some extent; but its prestige was
so much diminished in the eyes of Europe that an
alliance with the bishops was no longer, as of old,
an object of ambition to other states.</p>

<p>On the death of Charles the Bold Louis de
Bourbon, who was still Bishop, made up his mind
to devote himself in future to the government of
his Principality. As uncle of the young Duchess
Marie, who was the only daughter of Charles by
his second wife, Isabelle de Bourbon, he had sufficient
influence at the Court of Burgundy to obtain
important concessions in favour of Liége. A yearly
tribute of 30,000 florins, which the late Duke had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
exacted, was remitted, and the Liégeois were promised
the restoration of their ancient charters and
privileges. The Perron, to the possession of which
the people attached great importance, was sent
back from Bruges, and the townsmen showed their
gratitude to the Bishop by voting him a substantial
sum of money.</p>

<p>When he came to Liége, among the first to greet
him was William de la Marck, head of the ancient
house of Arenberg. Two of his ancestors had been
Bishops of Liége, and the family was one of the
greatest in the Principality. This William de la
Marck had been a warrior from his youth. He
was one of the handsomest men of his time, but to
make himself an object of fear to his enemies he
wore a long shaggy beard, and imitated the ferocious
manners of the brigands who had from time
immemorial haunted the most inaccessible part of
the Ardennes. On his coat of arms there was the
head of a wild boar, and, either for that reason or
because of his fierce character, he was nicknamed
the Wild Boar of Ardennes.</p>

anxious to raise fresh troubles in the Principality in
order to embarrass Charles of Burgundy and the
Bishop, had employed as  his agent de la Marck,
who, for the purpose of picking a quarrel with the
Bishop, caused one of the vicars, against whom he
had no cause of complaint, to be murdered in cold
blood. His favourite haunt was the Castle of
Aigremont, a fortalice perched on a hill above the
left bank of the Meuse, to the west of Liége. This
place the Bishop destroyed. Thereupon de la
Marck, who let it be understood that he was acting
in concert with the King of France, and by this
means obtained a numerous following among the
outlaws whom Charles of Burgundy had banished,
declared open war against both Louis de Bourbon
and the Duke.</p>

<p>But when the Bishop returned to Liége, on the
death of Charles and the accession of the Duchess
Marie, de la Marck hastened to make peace. The
Bishop granted him a pardon, made him Captain of
the Guard and Governor of Franchimont, rebuilt
the Castle of Aigremont, and loaded him with
favours. But it was soon apparent that the Wild
Boar was untamed. He set the rules of the Church
at defiance, refused to go to Mass or confession,
insisted on eating what he pleased in Lent, ruled all
who were under his authority with a rod of iron,
made himself universally hated by the nobles, and
at last, taking offence at the remonstrances of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Bishop, resigned his appointments, and left the
Court. It having been discovered that he was in
correspondence with Louis XI., who was plotting
the annexation of the Principality, a sentence of
banishment was pronounced against him as a traitor.
He retired into the Ardennes, where, assisted by
gifts of arms and gold from France, he gathered a
strong band of French, German, and Swiss adventurers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in August, 1482, news came to Liége
that the Wild Boar was on the march at the head
of 4,000 horse and foot. The Bishop went forth to
give him battle on the slopes of the Chartreuse, on
the right bank of the river opposite the town. De
la Marck, hearing from his spies that the Bishop
was coming on in front of his main body, and
attended only by a feeble escort, lay in wait for
him at a difficult part of the ascent. The surprise
was complete, and the escort was cut to pieces.
The Bishop, alone in the hands of his enemy, cried
out: 'Grâce! Grâce! Seigneur d'Arenberg, je
suis votre prisonnier!' But one of de la Marck's
followers struck him on the face. De la Marck
himself drew his sword, and wounded him in the
neck, and, turning to his men, told them to make
an end of it. In an instant the Bishop fell from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
his horse a dead man. They stripped his body, and
left it lying in the mud for hours; and it was with
difficulty that the clergy obtained permission to
bury him with the honours due to his station.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>De la Marck, now master of the situation, called
together the clergy of the diocese, and pressed them
to choose a new Bishop, suggesting his own son,
Jean d'Arenberg, a young man who was not yet a
priest, as the most suitable person. Some of the
canons, with whom the election lay, left Liége to
escape voting. Those who remained were terrified
into obedience, and the Wild Boar's son was declared
Bishop. De la Marck, at the same time,
appointed himself Governor of the Principality.</p>

<p>The murder of the Bishop, and the election of
the murderer's son to succeed him, led to new commotions.
A meeting of the canons who had fled
from Liége, and their brethren who had been
coerced into voting, was held at Namur. In that
town, out of the Wild Boar's 'sphere of influence,'
having declared the election of Jean d'Arenberg
null and void, they proceeded to vote again. On
this occasion they were divided into two parties.
Some supported Jacques de le Roy, the Count of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Chimay's brother, while others were in favour of
Jean de Home, a great noble who had been
made prisoner at the Chartreuse, but had afterwards
escaped.</p>

<p>There were thus three Bishops-Elect, and another
civil war broke out. The Archduke Maximilian<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
sent an army from Brabant into the Principality,
under Philip of Clèves, to avenge the death of
Louis de Bourbon. De la Marck laid waste the
lands of Jean de Horne, seized Tongres and other
towns, and marched, at the head of 16,000 Liégeois
and a number of mercenaries, against Philip of
Clèves. But his troops were no match for the
trained veterans of Brabant. The mercenaries were
driven back upon the Liégeois, who broke and ran.
This defeat did not quell the spirit of de la Marck;
but Louis XI., on whom he relied, died next year,
and the Pope declared in favour of Jean de Horne.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
De la Marck then saw that his wisest course was to
make peace, and in June, 1484, a convention was
signed at St. Trond, the terms of which show that
the Boar of the Ardennes was no mere bandit chief,
but an astute diplomatist, and a man of great influence
in the Principality. An indemnity of
30,000 livres was to be paid him by the town of
Liége, in security for which an assignment was
made in his favour of the lands of Franchimont and
the Duchy of Bouillon. If he should be attacked
by any who felt aggrieved by his recent proceedings,
the Bishop was to help him at all costs. Excesses
committed by either side were to be pardoned, and
those whose property had been damaged were to
have no claim for compensation.</p>

<p>When Jean de Horne, now duly accepted as
Bishop, made his state entry into Liége de la Marck
rode beside him, and the two soon became inseparable.
They usually dined together at the Bishop's
table. They gave each other presents. If there
was a fête, they attended it in company. They are
said to have even slept in the same bed, at that
time a favourite sign of friendship among the great.
But, though it seemed as if they were bent on
setting the people an example of mutual forgiveness
and brotherly love, there were some who shook
their heads, and hinted that the friendships of great
men who have been estranged are seldom sincere.</p>

<p>Next year there was a fête at St. Trond in honour
of the Bishop of Liége, at which all the nobles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the Principality, with their wives and daughters,
had assembled. De la Marck, of course, was there.
Feasting and dancing went on till late in the afternoon,
when the Bishop's brothers, Jacques de
Horne and Fréderic de Montigny, called for their
horses, saying they must start for Louvain. The
Bishop proposed to de la Marck that they should
ride part of the way in company, and to this he
agreed. So the Bishop, his two brothers, and de
la Marck rode together till they reached a level
plain, where de Montigny challenged de la Marck
to race him to a wood which was some distance
before them. They started, and left the others
behind. De la Marck, who was mounted on a very
swift horse, was soon in front, and galloped on till
he reached the wood. The moment he drew rein
a band of soldiers, who had been lying in ambush,
rushed out and surrounded him. Then de Montigny
rode up and said: 'You are my prisoner.'
De la Marck, who was not armed, asked what he
meant, on which de Montigny produced an order
for his arrest signed by the Archduke Maximilian,
and told him they must now go to Maestricht.
'Then,' said de la Marck at once, 'it is to my
death.'</p>

<p>They reached Maestricht in the evening, and soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
de la Marck was told that he had only a few hours
to live. During the night he was visited by the
Prior of the Dominicans, from whom, having made
confession, he received absolution. Early next
morning they brought him to the scaffold in the
market-place. A prodigious crowd had gathered
round it, and in a window close at hand, openly
rejoicing at the scene, was the Bishop of Liége.
De la Marck called to him in a loud voice, reproaching
him for his treachery, and uttered a solemn
warning that the Wild Boar's head, then about to
fall, would 'bleed for many a day.' He asked the
nearest of the spectators to carry his last farewells
to his wife and children. To his brothers and
friends he left the work of avenging his death.
He took off his cloak himself, and threw it to the
crowd. Then, lifting his long beard so that it
covered his face, he bent down, and the executioner
struck off his head with one blow.</p>

<p>The Archduke Maximilian had ordered the
arrest of de la Marck on the ground that he was
engaged in some fresh plot with France; but the
conduct of the Bishop and his brothers was loudly
condemned even in that age of perfidy. The family
of de la Marck swore vengeance, and the Principality
of Liége was once more bathed in blood.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></div>
<p>Calling to his aid the common people, who had
always loved the Wild Boar, and assisted behind
the scenes by the King of France, who wished to
excite the Liégeois against the Archduke Maximilian,
Everard de la Marck, William's brother,
made war against Jean de Horne. A sanguinary
struggle, in which no mercy was shown on either
side, went on for seven years, but at last the Bishop
and his friends made up their minds to sue for
pardon.</p>

<p>A conference was agreed to, which took place
on a meadow near Haccourt, on the Meuse between
Liége and Maestricht. On the appointed day the
Bishop-Prince, attended by his nobles, but himself
unarmed, met the brother of the man whom he
had so treacherously ensnared. Dismounting from
his horse, he approached Everard de la Marck, and
said: 'I ask you to pardon me for the death of
your brother William.'</p>

<p>Everard looked on him coldly, and said nothing,
whereupon the Bishop burst into tears, and sobbed:
'Seigneur Everard, pardon me. Pardon me, I implore
you by the death and passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ!' Then Everard, weeping also, answered:
'You ask pardon for the death of my brother in
the name of God, who died for us all? Well, I
pardon you.' So saying, he gave his hand to the
Bishop, and they swore to live at peace with each
other.</p>

<p>This strange reconciliation, which took place in

Bishop's niece to Everard de la Marck's son, and
thereafter there were no more feuds between the
families of de Horne and Arenberg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<small>ÉRARD DE LA MARCK&mdash;THE PRINCIPALITY IN THE
SIXTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">J</span><span class="smcap">ean de Horne</span> was Bishop of Liége for twenty-three
years, during which the diocese was seldom
free from party warfare. At the time of his death,
in 1506, the family of Arenberg was so strong and
popular that the Chapter of St. Lambert chose
Érard de la Marck, the Wild Boar's nephew, as
Bishop.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> He came to the episcopal throne resolved
to end the strife of factions and the family feuds
which had been the sources of such misery. He
forbade his subjects, under pain of banishment, to
rake up the old causes of dispute. He declined to
hear those who came to him bearing tales against
their neighbours. He chose the officers of his
Court without enquiring into their political opinions,
and let it be seen that, so long as the law was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
obeyed and public order maintained, no one was to
be called in question for anything which might
have happened in the past.</p>

<p>His foreign policy was equally wise. The Principality
of Liége lay between two mighty neighbours,
and at first the Bishop's aim was to remain neutral
in any disputes which might arise between the
Emperor and the King of France. But when, on
the death of Maximilian, Charles V. and Francis I.
were rivals for the imperial crown, he went to the
Diet at Frankfort, and supported the claims of
Charles. From that time the Principality, though
independent of the rest of Belgium, which formed
part of the dominions of Charles V., was in as close
relations with the German Empire as the electorate
of Cologne and other ecclesiastical fiefs.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The
bishops, chosen by the Chapter of Liége, and confirmed
by the Pope, were invested by the Emperor
with the secular power, and belonged to the Westphalian
circle of the German confederation.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span></div>

<p>In the strong hands of Bishop Érard the Principality
had one of its rare intervals of peace. He
found the city of Liége in debt, and the public
service disordered by want of money. Many plans
for raising funds were laid before him. He examined
them all, and then said to his council: 'If you will
leave everything to me for four years, I promise to
meet all your debts, and put your finances in order
without oppressing anyone, and without imposing
new taxes.' This offer was accepted, and, so great
was his talent for business, in two years Liége was
free from all liabilities. During his reign almost
every trace of the destruction wrought by Charles
the Bold disappeared. The citadel of Dinant was
restored. Huy and other places rose from their
ashes, and the Bishops' Palace, which stands in the
Place St. Lambert at Liége (the <i>Palais de Justice</i>
of to-day), was built. He died in 1538, having
kept the turbulent community of Liége quiet for
thirty years.</p>

<p>When the religious troubles of the sixteenth
century first began the reformed doctrines made
rapid progress, and the persecutors were busy in
Hainaut, Artois, and other Walloon districts in the
south-west of Belgium and along the French border.
Almost the whole population of Tournai in Hainaut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
was Calvinist. But the Principality of Liége,
governed by the bishop-princes, and independent
of Spain, did not suffer like the rest of the Netherlands
during the struggle. Nevertheless, before
the death of Érard de la Marck the spirit of revolt
against the Church of Rome had touched the valley
of the Meuse; and, in 1532, Jean Camolet, a
Carmelite father, came to Liége empowered by the
Pope to conduct an inquisition. The claim of the
Holy See to interfere with civil government was
known to the people; and the magistrates published
a declaration that the judges of the land were the
only persons who had the right to deal with
offences of any kind committed by the citizens.
The Bishop told them that the inquisitor was sent
by the Pope only to make enquiry into the beliefs
of those who were suspected of heresy, not to interfere
with the ordinary courts of law, and that there
was no intention of setting up the Spanish Inquisition
in the diocese. But the magistrates replied:
'We have our own laws. Our own judges can
deal with civil and criminal cases. In matters of
religion our own ecclesiastical courts are the only
competent tribunals, and we will not permit any
infringement of our ancient privileges.' Érard de
la Marck, who was far too wise a man to risk the dangers of
a revolution, took upon himself the responsibility of
enquiry into cases of heresy, and
thus saved the Principality from civil war.</p>

<h3>GENERAL VIEW OF DINANT</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_328fp.jpg" alt="GENERAL VIEW OF DINANT" width="600" height="420" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></div>

<p>But, at a later period, when the Netherlands were
in revolt from end to end, and William of Orange
was engaged in his stupendous contest with
Philip II., Gérard de Groisbeck, who was Bishop
from 1565 to 1580, found himself in a position of
peculiar difficulty. The Principality was at the
mercy of both parties. The reformers pillaged the
abbeys of Hastière and St. Hubert, and held a
great meeting at St. Trond, where the famous
battle-cry of 'Vivent les Gueux!' was shouted, and
defiance hurled at Philip and at Rome by a tumultuous
assemblage under the leadership of Brederode.
The Prince of Orange himself, driven out of
Brabant, demanded a free passage for his army, and
endeavoured to obtain possession of Liége. In this
he failed, but a garrison of Spanish troops was sent
to occupy the town, and the Bishop had to risk the
enmity of Alva by refusing to admit them. At
the Pacification of Ghent, in 1576, the Principality
of Liége was invited to join the United Provinces
of the Netherlands; but the people were, like the
Walloons in the other parts of Belgium, intensely
Catholic, and the invitation was refused. Bishop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
de Groisbeck was resolved to maintain the neutrality
of his domains. Liége, he announced with consent
of the three estates, was to remain a neutral State,
and take no part in the quarrels of its neighbours.
By this means he hoped to protect it from the
ravages of war, and, on the whole, he succeeded,
though there was fighting from time to time in the
Valley of the Meuse, and the Siege of Maestricht,
with all the horrors which followed the capture of
that town, took place almost at his own door. His
ideas of neutrality, however, may be gathered from
the fact that he sent 4,000 miners from his coal-mines
to help the besiegers of Maestricht. But the
Walloons were, at that time, Catholic beyond any
other of the Belgian races, and if the 'cry of agony
which was distinctly heard at the distance of a
league,' which arose from the heroic defenders as
the Spaniards rushed in, could have reached Liége,
it probably would not have touched the hearts of
many among the Liégeois. At all events, the
Bishop's policy was rewarded by a comparatively
tranquil reign, disturbed only by a series of petty
squabbles with the magistrates of Liége, who
claimed the right of holding the keys of the town,
a right which the Bishop maintained belonged to
him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Gérard de Groisbeck died in 1580. There had
often been a question whether it would not be
better for the people of Liége if the bishops were
chosen without regard to their family connections.
Men of high position, it was said, born in palaces,
and accustomed from their birth to flattery and the
deference paid to social rank, were more likely to be
overbearing and ambitious than persons of humbler
station. On the other hand, it was argued that a
small, turbulent State, surrounded by powerful
neighbours, required a ruler who could both secure
useful alliances against foreign aggressors, and command
the respect and obedience of his own subjects.
De Groisbeck had always thought that the Bishop
of Liége should be chosen from some royal family;
and on his death-bed he recommended as his successor
Prince Ernest of Bavaria, grandson of the
Emperor Ferdinand.</p>

<p>When the time came for the election of a new
bishop the States-General of the United Netherlands,
and the Courts of Spain and France, each
brought forward a candidate, but the Chapter of
Liége, wishing to remain neutral between these
rival interests, decided in favour of Prince Ernest
of Bavaria.</p>

<p>A description of his coming to Liége may give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
some idea of the ceremonies which attended the
installation of the bishop-princes. On June 15,
the day of his arrival, the magistrates went to
meet him on the outskirts of the town, and placed
in his hands a copy of the oath which his predecessors
had always sworn: that he would maintain
all the privileges of the townsmen and their municipal
laws, and would never encroach on their
liberties, nor allow them to be encroached on by
others. The Prince having taken this oath, the
keys of the town were presented to him. He
returned them to the burgomasters with the words:
'Hitherto you have guarded them faithfully, and
I leave them in your hands.' Then the Bishop's
horse was led forward to the gate, but as he drew
near one of the company of crossbow-men stepped
forward and closed it. The attendants shouted,
'Open for the Prince!' but the gate remained
closed till a town servant had three times demanded
in name of the burgomasters that it should be
opened, when this quaint formality came to an end,
and the Prince rode under the archway. Within
the walls he was met by the guild of crossbow-men,
to whom he promised the preservation of all their
rights, privileges, and liberties, after which the
procession marched on, led by a member of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Equestrian Order bearing the sword of state. Next
came a band of mounted halberdiers, riding before
the governors of the chief towns, who were clothed
in mantles of embroidered silk. These were followed
by the lords and gentry of the Principality.
Philip de Croy, Prince of Chimay, was there at the
head of 150 horsemen, together with the Prince
of Arenberg, the Duke of Juliers, the Duke of
Bavaria, and a long calvacade of nobles from other
parts of Belgium, and from foreign lands, each with
a numerous retinue of cavaliers. The Bishop-Prince
himself came last, riding between the burgomasters
of Liége, and attended by 800 gentlemen-at-arms.
A triumphal arch had been erected in the
street, on which stood a number of gaily dressed
maidens. When the Prince reached it the procession
stopped, and from the top of the arch a
large wooden pineapple, representing the arms of
the town, was lowered into the roadway to the
sound of music. It opened, and a beautiful young
girl came out, who recited some verses in honour
of the day, and presented the Prince with a gilded
basket full of jewelled ornaments and silver cups.
In the market-place there were three stages. On
the first were four boys, representing the ecclesiastical
estate, who presented a golden statue as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
symbol of the Christian Faith. At the second a
sword of honour, decorated with gold and precious
stones, was given by the estate of nobles. A golden
heart was the offering of the third estate. Close at
hand there was a platform, on which a man of the
common people knelt before a judge, holding in his
hands a scroll, on which were the words, 'Let both
sides be heard.'</p>

<p>At the door of the Cathedral of St. Lambert the
leader of the choir laid his hand on the Prince's
saddle to signify that, by ancient custom, he claimed
the horse and its trappings as the perquisites of his
office. When the procession had entered the
building the canons welcomed the Bishop in the
name of the Chapter, clothed him in a rich
cassock, and conducted him to the high altar,
where, the Bishop kneeling and the whole assemblage
of nobles and Churchmen standing round,
the oath sworn by every Bishop of Liége was read
aloud.</p>

<p>By this oath he bound himself to maintain unaltered
all the rights of the diocese. If he became
a cardinal, he must defend these rights before the
Holy See at Rome, and, above all, the right of the
Chapter to elect the Bishops of Liége. He must
not alienate any portion of the Principality without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the consent of the Chapter, nor suffer the country
to become tributary to any foreign State. His
usual place of residence must be within the Principality,
and if he had to leave it for a time he must
return when his presence was deemed necessary in
the interests of the people. He must impose no
taxes without the consent of the three estates. He
must not abandon any of the national strongholds,
and the commanders at such places as the castles
of Bouillon, Huy, and Dinant must be natives of
the country. No foreigner might hold any office
of State; and the Privy Council must be composed
of canons and other persons who had taken the oath
of fidelity to the Chapter. No alliances must be
made, no war declared, and no engagements of any
kind entered into with foreign Princes without
leave from the Chapter.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the many obligations
which were imposed upon the Princes of Liége.
Ernest of Bavaria swore to them all, but it was
soon apparent that it was impossible for the Principality
to hold aloof from all connection with external
politics. By this time the Reformation had
triumphed in the greater part of Germany; but the
House of Bavaria remained firmly attached to the
Catholic Church, and when Gérard Truchses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Archbishop of Cologne, and William de Meurs, Bishop
of Münster, abandoned the old faith, the vacant
Sees were conferred on Prince Ernest, who thus
not only held three bishoprics at the same time,
but had to defend his position by force of arms
against the Protestant princes. He spent most of
his time in Germany, while the Principality of
Liége was entered by Spanish and Dutch troops,
who behaved with equal harshness to the inhabitants.
A small party of Dutchmen surprised the
castle of Huy and took it, though without any
lives being lost on either side. Prince Ernest complained
on the ground that the Principality was
neutral, but the Dutch replied, and with perfect
truth, that the neutrality of Liége was a mere
pretence, as the Bishop was an active partisan on
the side of their enemies. He, therefore, asked
help from the Spaniards, by whom Huy was
stormed and recaptured after a stout resistance.
But, on the whole, it appears that, in spite of the
strict orthodoxy of the Liégeois, the Catholics were
even more unpopular than the Protestants, for the
Archduke Albert having complained that the
countryfolk showed more animosity against his
soldiers than against the Dutch, he was told that
people generally hated those most who did them most harm.
Prince Ernest himself spoke bitterly of the way in
which money was extorted for the
support of the Spanish garrisons in the Ardennes.</p>

<p>It was not till the Twelve Years' Truce was concluded
between the 'Archdukes' Albert and Isabella
and the States-General that the Principality was
freed from the incursions of foreign troops. This
was in 1609. Three years later Ernest of Bavaria
died, and was succeeded in the episcopal thrones of
Liége and Cologne by his nephew Ferdinand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<small>THE CHIROUX AND THE GRIGNOUX&mdash;THE TRAGIC
BANQUET OF WARFUSÉE</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">F</span><span class="smcap">erdinand of Bavaria's</span> reign was one long
quarrel with the magistrates of Liége. He soon
found that during his uncle's frequent absences
in Germany the burgomasters had usurped many
powers which had hitherto belonged to the Bishop.
They issued their own decrees without his authority,
and sometimes cancelled his orders without consulting
him. They took upon themselves to appoint
officers, to call the citizens to arms, and to send
representatives to foreign Courts. Their pretensions,
in short, had risen so high as to make it evident
that they aimed at nothing less than supreme
power.</p>

<p>At last a time came when matters were brought
to a crisis by the election as burgomasters of
two popular candidates, William Beeckmann and
Sébastien La Ruelle, whom the people insisted
on choosing against the wishes of Ferdinand, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
had irritated the Liégeois by bringing German and
Spanish troops into the Principality to support his
rights. Beeckmann died suddenly. A rumour that
he had been poisoned by the Bishop's friends inflamed
the passions of the mob, who listened eagerly to
La Ruelle when he told them that the intimate
relations of their Prince with Austria and Spain were
dangerous to the independence of the country.</p>

<p>There were at this time two factions in Liége&mdash;the
'Chiroux' and the 'Grignoux.' It appears that
some young men of rank had returned from a visit
to Paris dressed in the latest fashion, with white
stockings and boots falling over their calves, which
made the wits of the town say that they were like
a breed of swallows known as 'Chiroux.' One day,
at the Church of St. Lambert, some of the populace,
seeing a party of these dandies, called out, 'Chiroux!
Chiroux!' The others answered back with cries of
'Grignoux'&mdash;that is, <i>Grognards</i>, or malcontents.
Hence the nicknames. The Chiroux supported the
Bishop, while the Grignoux opposed him. The
former were, like Ferdinand, for maintaining close
relations with Germany, while the latter were
supposed to court a friendship with the King of
France. At this juncture we come across one of
the most curious episodes in the story of Liége.</p>

<h3>LE PERRON LIÉGEOIS, LIÉGE</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_340fp.jpg" alt="LE PERRON LIÉGEOIS, LIÉGE" width="392" height="600" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></div>

<p>A Baron de Pesche, who lived in the district
between the Sambre and the Meuse, having a
lawsuit before the judges at Liége, requested one
of his kinsmen, the Abbé de Mouzon, a Frenchman,
to manage the case. De Mouzon, an acute man
with a talent for political intrigue, made full use
of his opportunities, and soon knew all about the
feud between the Chiroux and the Grignoux, the
existence of German and French factions, and
everything that was going on in Liége. He
informed the Ministers of Louis XIII. that the
people of Liége were at heart favourable to France,
and that the ties which bound them to Germany
could easily be broken, as the Bishop was very
seldom in the Principality, and had no real influence
with his subjects. He had, he told the French
Government, made friends with the most important
men in the city, and was in a position to render
great services to France, provided he was furnished
with proper credentials. The result was that he
received a commission as French resident, or envoy,
at Liége. He then paid attentions to La Ruelle
and his party, for the purpose of persuading them
to further the interests of France and break with
Germany, and played his part so well that the
Chiroux leaders, becoming alarmed, sent a message
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
to the Bishop, advising him to be on his guard
against the intrigues of the French envoy and the
Grignoux.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, on receiving this warning, despatched
Count Louis of Nassau to Liége with a letter to
the magistrates, in which he reprimanded them
severely, and accused them of a treasonable correspondence
with France. La Ruelle answered in
acrimonious terms, declaring that the country was
being ruined by German soldiers sent there by the
Bishop. To this Ferdinand replied that, as the
Liégeois would not do their duty as loyal subjects
willingly, he would find means to compel them;
and presently an army of Imperial troops marched
into the Principality, and encamped near Liége.</p>

<p>And now a new actor comes upon the scene.
The Count of Warfusée, who had been employed
in turn by Spain and Holland, and betrayed them
both, was at this time living in banishment at
Liége. Posing as an adherent of the French side,
he secured the confidence of La Ruelle and the
Abbé de Mouzon, for both of whom he professed
a warm friendship; but, in reality, he was in correspondence
with the Court at Brussels, and had
promised that, if a few soldiers were placed at his
disposal, he would crush the French party in Liége.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></div>

<p>On April 17, 1637, he gave a dinner-party, to
which La Ruelle, Abbé de Mouzon, and other
guests were invited. When La Ruelle arrived,
accompanied by a young manservant named Jaspar,
Warfusée gave him a jovial greeting. Then,
noticing Jaspar, he exclaimed, 'Ah! there's my
good friend; I know him well,' and showed the
way to the kitchen, saying: 'You must enjoy
yourself to-day, and drink to the health of Burgomaster
La Ruelle.'</p>

<p>The company sat down to dinner in a room
on the ground floor, the windows of which had
iron bars across them, and opened on a courtyard
in the middle of the building. Count Warfusée
sat next the door, with M. Marchand, an advocate,
beside him. La Ruelle and the Abbé were on the
other side of the table. Baron de Saizan, a Frenchman,
and several other gentlemen were present,
and also some ladies, among whom were the
Baroness de Saizan and Count Warfusée's four
daughters. Every one was in the highest spirits.
The Count declared he felt so happy that he
intended to get drunk, and invited all the rest
to follow his example. Calling for big glasses,
he challenged de Mouzon to a revel. The Abbé
proposed the health of the Most Christian King;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and this toast was duly drunk, the gentlemen
rising, and uncovering their heads.</p>

<p>During the first course the merriment of the
party increased; but suddenly the Count's manner
changed, and one of the company was bantering
him about his gravity, when, as the servants were
bringing in the second course, his <i>valet de chambre</i>
came and whispered in his ear. Warfusée nodded,
and immediately twenty soldiers, each holding a
drawn sword in one hand and a firelock in the
other, entered the room, bowed, and surrounded
the table. The guests supposed that this was some
pleasantry devised for their amusement; and La
Ruelle asked his host what it meant. 'Nothing,'
answered Warfusée&mdash;'do not move;' but as he
spoke a band of Spaniards appeared at the windows,
and levelled their muskets through the bars. Warfusée,
pointing to Jaspar, who was waiting on his
master, ordered the soldiers to remove him. He
was seized and turned out of the room. The
Count then shouted, 'Arrest the burgomaster!'</p>

<p>'What? Arrest me?' exclaimed La Ruelle,
rising and throwing his napkin on the table.</p>

<p>'Yes, you,' replied Warfusée, 'and Abbé de
Mouzon, and Baron de Saizan also.'</p>

<p>The soldiers took La Ruelle, and dragged him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
out; and Warfusée, shouting at the top of his
voice, declared that he was acting under the orders
of the Emperor, and of His Royal Highness the
Bishop. They had, he said, borne long enough
with the intrigues of the French, and the authority
of the Prince must be re-established. A scene of the
wildest confusion followed. Warfusée rushed into
the courtyard, and loaded La Ruelle with insults.
'Ropes, ropes for the burgomaster!' he shouted.
'Ah! you traitor! your heart is in my hands today.
See, here are the orders of the Prince'; and
he pulled some papers out of his pocket. 'Make
your peace with God, for you must die.' Jaspar,
the servant, who was standing near, already bound,
is said to have exclaimed, when he heard these
words, 'Oh, master, have I not always said what
would happen?'</p>

<p>All in vain La Ruelle begged for mercy. Two
Dominicans, sent for to shrive the victim, implored
the Count to pause; but 'Kill him, kill him! Make
haste. Lose no more time,' was his answer to their
entreaties, and to those of his own daughters, who
besought him, with tears, to spare the unfortunate
man's life. Some of the soldiers refused to touch
the burgomaster, and told Warfusée to his face
that they were not assassins. But at last three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Spaniards drew their daggers, and stabbed La
Ruelle repeatedly till he was dead.</p>

<p>His cries were heard in the room where De
Mouzon, fearing that his own last hour had come,
was waiting with the other guests under guard of
the soldiers. The Dominicans entered; and all
were crowding round them, pouring out confessions
and clamouring for absolution, when Warfusée
came to the door, and told them that the burgomaster
was dead, and that he had died repenting
of his misdeeds, and seeking forgiveness from God,
the Emperor, and the Bishop. Having said this,
he went away again.</p>

<p>In the meantime a report had spread through
the town that something unusual was happening.
It was said that a band of Spanish soldiers had
been seen to cross the Meuse, and go to the Count
of Warfusée's house, where the burgomaster was
known to be dining that day; and every one suspected
that they had been sent to arrest La Ruelle,
De Mouzon, Warfusée, and their friends. So a
cousin of the burgomaster's went to find out if this
was the case. When he reached the door of the
house he found a crowd of people, who told him
they had heard cries from within and the clash of
arms, and that there was a rumour that the burgomaster had been murdered.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></div>

<p>On hearing this, he
knocked at the door, which was opened by the
Count, who let him enter with a few of his friends.</p>

<h3>LA VIEILLE BOUCHERIE, LIÉGE</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_346fp.jpg" alt="LA VIEILLE BOUCHERIE, LIÉGE" width="405" height="600" /></div>

<p>'Tell me, gentlemen,' said Warfusée, 'do you
wish to be Spanish, or French, or Dutch?'</p>

<p>'No,' they replied, 'we wish to remain what we
are&mdash;neutrals and true Liégeois.'</p>

<p>'What would you think,' the Count asked them,
'if you heard that La Ruelle has sold your country
to France?'</p>

<p>'We would not believe it,' they all replied.</p>

<p>'Do you know his signature?' Warfusée inquired,
showing them some documents.</p>

<p>'These are forgeries,' they told him.</p>

<p>'No matter!' exclaimed the Count;' I had orders
to kill La Ruelle. He is already dead, and I hold
Abbé de Mouzon and Baron de Saizan prisoners.
Would you like to see La Ruelle's body?'</p>

<p>To this they replied 'No,' and asked permission
to leave the house.</p>

<p>By this time the news of the burgomaster's death
was known in the town, and a vast crowd had
gathered in front of the house, shouting 'To
arms!' and demanding admission. The Count
ventured to open the door, and allow the burgomaster's
cousin and his friends to escape. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
noise increased, as the people knocked loudly at
the door, and uttered threats of vengeance upon
the Count. Warfusée, now trembling in every
limb, pale and terror-stricken, ran hither and
thither between the courtyard and the garden,
and at last hid himself in a room on the upper
story, just as an armed crowd of townsmen burst
in, and forced their way to where the soldiers were
guarding Abbé de Mouzon and the other prisoners.
Baron de Saizan at once called on the Spaniards to
give up their weapons, and promised them quarter.
They allowed themselves to be disarmed; but the
townsmen instantly attacked them. There was
a short, but desperate, struggle, during which the
ladies, cowering on the floor, protected themselves
as best they could from the musket-balls which
flew about, and the sword-cuts which the infuriated
townsmen dealt in all directions. In a few minutes
the Spaniards were slain to the last man; and then
some of the burghers, moved by pity, led the
daughters of Warfusée from the blood-stained
house to the Hôtel de Ville, where they obtained
shelter.</p>

<p>Their father at this time was lying on a bed
upstairs, where he was soon discovered by La
Ruelle's cousin, who had returned, and some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
burghers, who dragged him down to the door of
the house and threw him out into the street. The
mob rushed upon him, stabbed him, and beat him
to death with bludgeons, tore off his clothes, pulled
him by the feet to the market-place, hung him
head downwards on the gallows, and finally tore
the dead body to pieces. A fire was lighted, his
remains were burned, and the ashes thrown into
the Meuse.</p>

<p>Even this revenge did not quench the thirst
for blood which consumed the people of Liége.
The advocate Marchand, who had been one of
Warfusée's guests, and another eminent citizen,
Théodore Fléron, fell under suspicion, and were
slaughtered. It is said that one of those who slew
Fléron was so mad with rage that he flung himself
on the dead man's corpse, tore it with his teeth
like a wild beast, and sucked the blood. The
church of the Carmelites, who were also suspected
of some guilty knowledge of Warfusée's plot, was
sacked. The Rector of the Jesuits was murdered,
and the members of that society were driven from
the town. The mob went through the streets
shouting, 'Death to the Chiroux! Death to the
priests!' A list was drawn up of suspected persons,
who were condemned, without trial, on a charge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
of having conspired against the State; and many
of the Chiroux faction were hung on the gallows.</p>

<p>Such is the horrible story of the 'Tragic Banquet
of Warfusée,' as it is called in local history. The
motive for the crime, as foolish as it was brutal,
was obviously the wish of Warfusée to gain, at
any cost, some credit with the Emperor, though
there seems to be no proof that either the Emperor
or Ferdinand had really authorized the murder
of the burgomaster. Nor is there evidence to
show that La Ruelle had plotted to hand over
the Principality to France. The only explanation
of Warfusée's extraordinary folly seems to be that
he had entirely misunderstood the sentiments of
the Liégeois, and had under-estimated the popularity
of La Ruelle and the strength of the Grignoux
faction. Otherwise, desperate villain though he
was, he would scarcely have ventured to commit
such a crime with no support save that of a few
soldiers.</p>

<h3>THE EPISCOPAL PALACE&mdash;INNER COURT,<br />

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351-352]</a></span></div>

<p>A semblance of peace followed; but soon the
feud between the Chiroux and the Grignoux broke
out again. Once more the Grignoux obtained the
upper hand. The Episcopal Palace was taken by
the mob. Two hundred citizens of the upper class
were ordered into banishment; and when the Bishop was
on his way to Liége, hoping to restore order
by peaceful means, he was met by the news
that the gates were closed against him. He therefore
sent his nephew, Prince Henry Maximilian
of Bavaria, with an army to reduce the town. In
a skirmish near Jupille one of the burgomasters
was killed. The Grignoux lost heart, and opened
the gates. Then came a wholesale arrest of the
popular leaders, four of whom were executed. The
mode of electing magistrates was altered, the
Bishop reserving to himself the right of nominating
half of them. The loyalists who had been banished
were recalled. To overawe the people, a citadel
was built upon the high ridge above the town;
and when Ferdinand died, in 1650, the Principality
was more at rest than it had been for many years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<small>THE GAMING-TABLES AT SPA&mdash;THE FRENCH
REVOLUTION&mdash;ANNEXATION OF THE PRINCIPALITY</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">A</span><span class="smcap">lready</span> two Princes of Bavaria had been Bishops
of Liége, and now a third succeeded, Prince
Maximilian Henry, who filled this uneasy throne
from 1650 to 1688.</p>

<p>During most of that time the armies of almost
every nation in Europe swept like a flood over the
Principality; but the most important transaction
of Maximilian's reign was the establishment of a
new system for the election of magistrates. This
system, which came into force in November, 1684,
and was known as the 'Réglement de Maximilien
de Bavière,' deprived the lower classes of that direct
power of election which they had so long abused,
and divided it between the Bishops and the middle
class. The result of this measure was that there
was quiet, if not harmony, within the walls of Liége
for the next hundred years. During that period,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
from 1684 to 1784, the valley of the Meuse was
frequently the seat of war in the various campaigns
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>More tranquil times came with the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
in 1748, when the Austrian Netherlands
were restored to the Empress Maria Theresa.
It was, indeed, only a calm between two storms.
But for some years the arts of peace flourished in
the valley of the Meuse; and side by side with a
remarkable progress of industry and commerce the
intellectual activity of the people increased. An
association, called the 'Société d'Emulation,' was
formed, chiefly for the study of French literature;
and soon the works of Voltaire, of Diderot, and of
d'Alembert were read by all classes. The clergy
tried to forbid the purchase of such books, but in
vain. Amongst the working class the favourite
authors were those who attacked the clergy; and
the writings of Voltaire became so popular that
secret meetings were held in many of the country
villages for the purpose of hearing them read aloud.
Thus, beneath the surface, the spirit of inquiry and
free thought was fostered. Already in France the
first murmurs of the coming storm were heard; and
in Liége people began to speak about the 'rights of
man,' to question the dogmas of the Church, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
ridicule the priests at whose feet their forefathers
had knelt for so many hundred years.</p>

<p>While these new forces were gathering strength,
César de Hoensbroeck, one of the Canons of
St. Lambert, became Bishop, on July 21, 1784. A
trifling dispute with which his reign began was the
prelude to very serious events. For many years a
company called the 'Société Deleau' had enjoyed
a monopoly of the gaming-tables at Spa, under a
grant from the Bishops of Liége, to whom a third
of the profits were paid. In 1785 one Levoz, a
citizen of Liége, opened a new gambling-house,
which he called the 'Club.' The Société Deleau
protested against this infringement of its monopoly.
Levoz and his friends replied that by law the Bishops
had no right to grant a monopoly without the
sanction of the estates; and at last the case was
laid before the Imperial Chamber of the German
Empire.</p>

<p>This petty quarrel, so trivial in its origin, had run
its course for more than two years, when suddenly
it was raised into a grave controversy by one of the
partisans of Levoz, Nicolas Bassenge, who published
a series of letters in which he declared that the
liberties of the country were at stake. 'It is not,'
he said, 'a mere question about a game of hazard.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Which is to be supreme, he asked, the Prince or the
people? Who has the right to make laws or grant
monopolies? The chief of the State is not its
master, but merely the instrument of the national
will. Others followed Bassenge in the same strain;
and more letters, fresh recriminations, hot words
and angry answers, added fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>Levoz, tired of waiting for a decision from the
Imperial Chamber, leased his Club to a manager,
Paul Redouté, who opened it with dancing added
to the attractions of dice and cards. The Bishop
sent 200 soldiers to Spa, who closed the Club tables,
and forbade all gaming except in the rooms to
which he had granted the monopoly. A warrant
was issued for the arrest of Redouté and M.
Ransonnet, who had fought in the American War
of Independence, and was now a leader among the
disaffected party in Liége. The latter fled to
Brussels, where the Brabant revolution against
Joseph II. was approaching its climax, and sent
letters to Liége, in which he said that a plan
was on foot to establish a republic consisting of
Brabant and the Principality of Liége. Would it
not, he asked, be a glorious work to confine the
Bishops to their Apostolic mission, as in the days of
St. Hubert? Words like these made a deep impression at
a time when the old influences of tradition and custom
were beginning to lose their force.</p>

<h3>PONT DU PROPHÈTE, PROMENADE
MEYERBEER, SPA WOODS</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_356fp.jpg" alt="PONT DU PROPHÈTE, PROMENADE

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></div>

<p>In the spring and summer of 1789 there was
much suffering among the poor, owing to a bad
season; and the Bishop arranged to celebrate
July 21, the anniversary of his election, by a distribution
of bread among the destitute. But before
July 21 came, horsemen had galloped up the Valley
of the Meuse with tidings of the wonderful things
which had been done in France. 'Workers of
iniquity,' Bassenge wrote, 'behold Paris, and
tremble!'</p>

<p>The Bastille had fallen on July 14, and a
month later almost to a day, on August 16, the
revolution in Liége began. For two days the
people did nothing but march about the streets;
but very early on the morning of Tuesday the 18th
the tocsin was sounding over the town, and soon
the market-place was filled by an immense crowd,
all wearing cockades of red and yellow, the national
colours. Baron de Chestret marched at the head
of 200 armed men into the Hôtel de Ville, and
expelled the burgomasters. This was followed
by the election, at the famous Perron, of new
burgomasters, one of them being Baron de Chestret,
who, later in the day, went with a number of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
insurgents to the Bishop's palace at Seraing, and
demanded his presence in the city, and his written
approval of what had been done. The Bishop,
adorned with a red and yellow cockade, was hurried
to Liége by the mob, who crowded round his
carriage, shouting, blowing trumpets, and beating
drums. The horses were taken out, and the rioters
drew him to the Hôtel de Ville, and brought him
into a room where the light of a single candle
showed a number of men waiting for him sword in
hand. A threatening voice came from the darkness,
saying, 'The nation demands your signature. Make
haste!' and the Bishop forthwith signed a number of
documents which were placed before him, without
waiting to read the contents. On the morrow he
returned to Seraing; but a few days later he
departed secretly for Tréves.</p>

<p>For nearly two years the Imperial Chamber was
occupied with the question of Liége; but at last,
when the revolution in Brabant had been suppressed,
an Austrian army entered the Principality. Everything
which the revolutionary party had done since
August 18,1789, was declared null and void. The
burgomasters who had been expelled were restored
to office. Those Canons of St. Lambert who had
fled were brought back, and the Bishop himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
returned. The Société d'Emulation, which had
done so much to encourage the study of Voltaire,
was suppressed. Sentences of banishment, and even
of death, were pronounced against some of those
who had led the revolt; and there can be little doubt
that Bishop Hoensbroeck earned the title of 'prêtre
sanguinaire,' which was given him at the Courts of
Berlin and Vienna. He died in June, 1792; and in
August of that year his nephew, the Comte de
Méan, was elected by the Chapter. But before the
new Bishop's inauguration the army of the French
Republic, fresh from its victory at Jemappes, having
driven the Austrians beyond the Meuse, took
possession of Liége. This was on November 28,
1792.<br /></p>

<p>Dumouriez, who had entered Brussels without
opposition, received a hearty welcome at Liége,
where the popular sentiment was in favour of an
union with France; and in every part of the
Principality resolutions were passed for incorporating
the country with the Republic. It is said
that, shortly before August 18, 1789, Mirabeau
dined at Liége with Bassenge and some of the
revolutionary leaders, when the conversation turned
on the affair of Spa. The constitution of Liége
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
was explained to him. 'And you are not contented
with that?' he said. 'Gentlemen, let me
tell you that if in France we had enjoyed half your
privileges, we would have thought ourselves happy.'
But there had always been a charm in the word
'Republic' for the people of Liége. 'Men of
Liége,' said Nicolas Bassenge, when the National
Convention at Paris decreed the annexation of
the Netherlands, 'our lot is fixed: we are French.
To live or die Frenchmen is the wish of our hearts,
and no wish was ever so pure, so earnest, or so
unanimous.'</p>

<p>Thomas Bassenge, brother of Nicolas, was at this
time a member of the Municipal Council of Liége;
and in February, 1793, he persuaded the magistrates
to celebrate the revolution by destroying
the Cathedral of St. Lambert, which stood near
the Episcopal Palace of Érard de la Marck. The
front of this church, the finest ecclesiastical building
in the Principality, was a mass of elaborate carving.
Statues of angels and archangels, of patriarchs and
prophets, of martyrs and of saints, rose one above
the other, and over them innumerable pinnacles
were interlaced by a maze of slender arches, crossing
each other with tracery so delicate as almost to
resemble lace. Beneath this profusion of stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>work
the great doorway was adorned with marble
statues of the benefactors of the church from the
chisel of Lambert Zoutman, a sculptor of Liége;
and in the interior of the building, with its marble
columns and windows of old stained glass, were many
paintings, the tombs of the Bishops, rich tapestries,
a jewelled bust of Lambert, and many objects of
value, amongst which were two golden statues sent
by Charles the Bold to the shrine of the patron
saint, as an act of expiation after he had destroyed
the town. This building, which had survived the
great disaster of the fifteenth century, was now
completely wrecked. The statues and the monuments
were cast down. The mausoleum of Érard
de la Marck was sold and broken up. The graves
were opened, the bones thrown out, and the lead
of the coffins used for bullets. The clocks were
sent up the Meuse in barges to France, and there
turned into copper money. Everything valuable
was removed, and soon nothing remained but the
bare walls, which in a few years crumbled into
ruins. Thus the long line of the Bishop-Princes of
Liége, and the place in which for centuries they
had been inaugurated, fell together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<small>LIÉGE AND THE VALLEY OF THE MEUSE IN
MODERN TIMES&mdash;BOUILLON</small></h2>

<p><span class="p125">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> territory which the Bishops had governed was
now merged in four of the nine departments into
which the National Convention divided the annexed
Austrian Netherlands. The department of 'Forêts,'
with Luxembourg for its capital, included the
Ardennes. The western portion of the old diocese
was sunk in 'Sambre et Meuse,' of which Namur
was the chief town. 'Ourthe' was the name given
to the district in which Liége was situated. To
the east lay the department of 'Meuse Inférieure,'
with Maestricht for its capital. Thus the old
boundaries of the Principality were entirely
obliterated. The Convention conferred the rights
of French citizens on the people of these districts,
and commissioners were sent from Paris to divide
the country into cantons, and establish a new
system of local administration on the French model.</p>

<p>The departments of Forêts, Sambre et Meuse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Ourthe, and Meuse Inférieure were in the same
condition as the rest of Belgium during the closing
years of the eighteenth century and down to the
fall of Napoleon. After that they formed part of
the 'Kingdom of the Netherlands,' under the
House of Orange-Nassau, and were called the
provinces of Luxembourg, Namur, Liége, and
Limbourg.</p>

<p>When the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the
chief constructive work accomplished by the Congress
of Vienna, fell to pieces in 1830, the Liégeois
went with the rest of Belgium in the revolution
against William I. As soon as they heard of the
insurrection at Brussels, the townsmen of Liége
met, as of old, in the market-place, put on the
national colours, and helped themselves to weapons
from the armourers' shops. A company of 300
volunteers, with two pieces of cannon, marched
across Brabant into Brussels, and took a prominent
part in the street fighting, which ended in the
retreat of the Dutch troops, and the triumph
of the revolution which led to the separation of the
Catholic Netherlands from Holland, and the election
of Leopold I. as King of Belgium.</p>

<h3>PONT DE JAMBES ET CITADELLE, NAMUR</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_364fp.jpg" alt="PONT DE JAMBES ET CITADELLE, NAMUR" width="600" height="477" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></div>

<p>Long ago, in the days of Prince Maximilian of
Bavaria, a fortress was built on the only bridge
which at that time crossed the Meuse at Liége.
This fortress, armed with cannon which could
sweep both sides of the river, left only one narrow
waterway, nicknamed 'The Dardanelles,' by which
boats could pass up and down the stream. It has
long since disappeared, and the present Pont des
Arches now occupies the sight of the old bridge.
The irregular outline of the houses on the bank of
the Meuse, with their fronts of grey, white, and
red, the church towers appearing over the roofs of
the town behind, and the ridge of the citadel rising
high in the background, are best seen from the
Pont des Arches, from which the modern Rue
Leopold leads straight into the very heart of Liége,
to the place on which the Cathedral of St. Lambert
stood. It is just a century since the last stones of
the old church were carted away; and now the
Place St. Lambert, like the Place Verte, which
opens on it from the west, and the market-place,
which is a few yards to the east, has a bright look
of business and prosperity, with its shops and cafés.</p>

<p>The Episcopal Palace, now the Palais de Justice,
the erection of which took thirty years during the
commencement of the sixteenth century, has undergone
many alterations since the days of Érard de
la Marck. Two hundred years after it was finished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
a fire destroyed the original front, which had to be
rebuilt, and the rest of the vast structure was
restored in the nineteenth century. The primitive
façade has been replaced by one moulded on
severely classic lines; but the inner squares, with
their picturesque cloisters, are strangely rich in
types of every style, a medley of Gothic, Renaissance,
Moorish, as if symbolic of the vicissitudes
undergone by the Bishop-Princes who inhabited
this immense building. Most of the grotesque
carvings, the demons in stone, and the fantastic
figures which surround these courts, were conceived
by the luxuriant imagination of Francis
Borset, a sculptor of Liége.</p>

<p>Close to the Episcopal Palace is the market-place,
where so many of the scenes described
in these pages took place, and where now stands
the modern Perron, designed by Delcour at the
end of the seventeenth century to replace the old
column, at the foot of which the laws of the
Principality, peace, or war used to be proclaimed.
There is nothing about it to recall the history of
the stormy times when Charles the Bold carried it
off into Flanders; but the tradition of the ancient
Perron still survives.</p>

<p>At Brussels, Ghent, Bruges, Louvain, the Hôtels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
de Ville retain their aspect of the Middle Ages,
when they were the centres of that passionate civic
life which throbs through all the history of the
Netherlands. But the Hôtel de Ville of Liége is
modern, of the eighteenth century. It would make
a commodious private mansion, but has nothing in
common with the architectural gems which adorn
the great cities of Flanders and Brabant.</p>

<p>This lack of architectural distinction is characteristic
of modern Liége. The hammers of the
French Revolution, in destroying the Cathedral
of St. Lambert, completed what the fires of Charles
the Bold began, and of the really old Liége almost
nothing remains. But the fiery spirit which once
led to so many wars and revolutions now finds an
outlet in useful work. The industrious character
of the Walloons is perhaps most highly developed
in other Walloon parts of Belgium&mdash;among the
carpet factories of Tournai, the iron-works of
Charleroi, the flax-works of Courtrai, and in the
coal-mines of the Borinage, which blacken the
landscape for miles round Mons. But the people
of Liége have always been famous for their skill in
working steel and iron. In the old days they
forged the weapons of war which they used so
often; and at the present time there are in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
town many flourishing companies who turn out
large quantities of guns, engines, and machinery,
while up the Meuse there are coal-mines, furnaces,
and factories, where the Walloons toil as laboriously
as in Hainaut.</p>

<p>In the year after Waterloo William I. and John
Cockerill, an Englishman, established iron-works at
Seraing, within a few miles of Liége. In 1830, when
the Kingdom of the Netherlands was broken up,
Cockerill became owner of the business, which has
grown since then, until it is now one of the largest
iron manufactories in Europe, with some twelve
thousand workmen constantly employed in its coal-mines
and engine-works. The Palace at Seraing,
from which Bishop Hoensbroeck was carried by the
revolutionary mob to the Hôtel de Ville at Liége
in the summer of 1789, is now the office of the
well-known firm of John Cockerill and Company.</p>

<h3>CHÂTEAU DE BOUILLON, IN THE SEMOIS
VALLEY</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_368fp.jpg" alt="CHÂTEAU DE BOUILLON, IN THE SEMOIS
VALLEY" width="600" height="395" /></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></div>

<p>Beyond Seraing the Valley of the Meuse winds
up through the centre of what was once the
Principality of Liége, and at every turn there is
something which recalls the olden time. The
white Château of Aigremont, where the Wild
Boar of Ardennes used to live, stands boldly on
its hilltop on the left bank of the river.
A little farther, and we come to the Condroz country,
with its capital Ciney, notorious for the insane
'War of the Cow,' and Huy, with the grave of
Peter the Hermit, and its long history of suffering.
The whole valley is so peaceful now, full of quiet
villages, gardens, hay-fields, and well-cultivated
land, that it is difficult to realize that for centuries
it was nothing but a battlefield, and that in
these regions the people suffered almost as much
from the depredations of their friends as from the
enemy, even long after the barbarism of the
Burgundian period was a thing of the past. 'We
have,' says Field-Marshal de Merode, during the
campaigns of Louis XIV., 'eighteen miserable
regiments of infantry, and fourteen of cavalry and
dragoons, who are just six thousand beggars or
thieves, for they have neither money nor clothing,
and live by plunder on the highways, stopping
public and private coaches, robbing travellers, or,
pistol in hand, demanding at least a <i>pour boire</i>.
Nobody can go from one place to another without
meeting them, which ruins business and the whole
country.'</p>

<p>The situation of Namur, at the junction of the
Sambre and the Meuse, made it a place of great
importance in every war, not only in the Middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Ages, but also in later times. When the Grand
Alliance was formed against France, it was in
Brabant that the main body of the Allies gathered;
but before long the tide of war rolled into the
Valley of the Meuse. Liége was bombarded for
five days by Marshal Boufflers, and the Bishop,
from his place of refuge in the citadel, saw the
Hôtel de Ville and half the town set on fire by the
shells which flew over the river from the French
batteries on the Chartreuse. As the struggle went
on, Huy was destroyed by Marshal Villeroi, Namur
fell into the hands of Louis XIV., and farther
afield it seemed as if no city, however strong, could
stand a siege against the genius of Vauban, while
the victories at Steinkirk and Landen made the
arms of France appear invincible. But at last, in
1695, came the siege and capture of Namur by
William III. The taking of Namur was the turning-point
of that war, and led to the Treaty of
Ryswick, by which Spain recovered Luxembourg,
and all the conquests which the King of France
had made in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Again, when the War of the Spanish Succession
began, the English army, on its way to Germany,
marched into the Principality of Liége, took the
town and citadel of Liége, drove the French over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
the Meuse, and carried the war to Blenheim on the
Danube. But though the first of Marlborough's
chief victories was thus gained in Bavaria, the
second of his four great battles was fought to obtain
command of the way to Namur. Marshal Villeroi's
object in giving battle at Ramillies was to protect
that town, which he regarded as the key to the
Valley of the Meuse; but fortune had deserted
France, and the combat of May 23, 1706, decided
the fate not only of the Principality of Liége, but
of all Belgium, though the war continued through
the carnage of Oudenarde and Malplaquet, till the
Peace of Utrecht.</p>

<p>Even now the shadow of a possible war overhangs
this part of Europe; and if those who think
that, sooner or later, the neutrality of Belgium will
be violated are right, it is very likely that the line
of the Meuse, with its navigable stream, its railway,
and its roads, so well adapted for military purposes,
will be used. It is in view of this danger that the
fortifications along the valley are maintained.
Within a radius of six miles round Liége there are
twelve forts. The citadel of Huy, planned by
William I. soon after the campaign of Waterloo,
was enlarged and made stronger so lately as 1892.
Namur is surrounded by nine forts at a distance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
about six miles from the town; and the citadel of
Dinant forms an outpost to the south-west.</p>

<p>The last occasion on which any part of Belgium,
so long the 'Cockpit of Europe,' had a glimpse of
war was in the autumn of 1870. The battle of
Sedan had been fought within a few miles from the
southern slopes of the Ardennes, and during
September 3 thousands of wounded men and
prisoners from the beaten army were crowded in
Bouillon, a little town which lies in the gorge of the
Semois, just over the Belgian frontier.</p>

<p>This place was once the capital of a Duchy. On
a lofty rock, almost surrounded by the dark, brown
waters of the many-winding Semois, stands the
ruined castle of the Dukes of Bouillon, a large pile
of grey walls and towers, which gives some idea of
the immense strength of the fortresses which, even
in the remote forest-land of Ardennes, the feudal
lords built for themselves. The age of this stronghold
is unknown, but there seems reason to believe
that a fort was erected on this rock by the Princes
of Ardennes so early as the seventh century. In
the eleventh century it was ceded to the Principality
of Liége by the famous Crusader Godfrey of
Bouillon; but this part of the Ardennes, on the
borders of France and Luxembourg, was a kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
'Debatable Land,' and there were frequent
struggles for the Duchy between the Bishops of
Liége and the family of de la Marck. The Wild
Boar of Ardennes obtained possession of it, and his
son usurped the title of Duke of Bouillon; but one
of his descendants having incurred the wrath of
Charles V., the castle was taken, the town sacked,
and the Duchy restored to the Bishops of Liége.
They retained it till it fell into the hands of
Louis XIV., by whom it was given to the family of
La Tour d'Auvergne, the representatives of the
de la Marcks. It became a small Republic after
the French Revolution, but was included in the
Kingdom of the Netherlands from 1815 to 1830.
Since then it has formed part of Belgian Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Bouillon, with its mountains and woods, and its
romantic ruin, being one of the loveliest spots in
the Ardennes, soon became a favourite place for
holiday-makers, and had for many years a peaceful
existence before the storm burst so near it in that
eventful year 1870. 'I was there,' M. Camille
Lemonnier says, 'in the midst of the <i>débâcle</i>, and,
sick at heart, and in the horror of those days, wrote
these words: "A furious coming and going filled
the streets. We found the <i>Place</i> crowded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
townspeople, peasants, lancers, prisoners, and
wounded men struggling among the horses' hoofs,
the wheels of wagons, and the feet of the stretcher-bearers.
A horrible noise rose in the darkness of
the evening from this tumultuous crowd, who
moved aimlessly about, with staring eyes, lost in
agony, and scarcely knowing what they did. A
stupor seemed to weigh on every brain; and all
round, looking down on the seething mass, lights
twinkled in the windows of the houses. Behind the
white blinds of one house, the Hôtel de la Poste, at
the corner to the left of the bridge, a restless shadow
moved about all night long. It was the shadow of
the last Bonaparte, watching, and a prisoner, while
near him the frantic cries wrung by defeat from the
wreckage of the French army died away in sobs and
spasms."'</p>

<p>Next morning Napoleon III., who had spent the
night in the Hôtel de la Poste, left with a guard of
Prussian officers, climbed up the road, through the
woods which lie between the valleys of the Semois
and the Lesse, to Libramont, whence he journeyed
by train to Wilhelmshoe.</p>

<p>Since then Bouillon has returned to the quiet
times which preceded the Franco-German War;
but that student of history must have a very dull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
imagination who does not find much to think of in
this narrow valley, on the frontiers of Belgium and
France, where the past and the present meet, the
day when Duke Godfrey rode off to plant his
standard on the walls of Jerusalem, and the day
when his castle looked down on the humiliation of
the ruler who began his reign by making war about
the Holy Places of Palestine.</p>
